# Deep Learning Medical Image Analyis

This is a high-level introduction into practical machine learning for purposes of medical image classification.

We provide 75 images, 38 are chest X-rays, and 37 are abdominal X-rays. These de-identified PNGs obtained from openI, https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/, a searchable online repository of medical images from published PubMed Central articles
