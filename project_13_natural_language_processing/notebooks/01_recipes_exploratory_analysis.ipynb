       "{'1': '\\nBROTH OR SOUP STOCK\\n\\n(Brodo)\\n\\nTo obtain good broth the meat must be put in cold water, and then\\nallowed to boil slowly. Add to the meat some pieces of bones and \"soup\\ngreens\" as, for instance, celery, carrots and parsley. To give a brown\\ncolor to the broth, some sugar, first browned at the fire, then diluted\\nin cold water, may be added.\\n\\nWhile it is not considered that the broth has much nutritive power, it\\nis excellent to promote the digestion. Nearly all the Italian soups are\\nmade on a basis of broth.\\n\\nA good recipe for substantial broth to be used for invalids is the\\nfollowing: Cut some beef in thin slices and place them in a large\\nsaucepan; add some salt. Pour cold water upon them, so that they are\\nentirely covered. Cover the saucepan so that it is hermetically closed\\nand place on the cover a receptacle containing water, which must be\\nconstantly renewed. Keep on a low fire for six hours, then on a strong\\nfire for ten minutes. Strain the liquid in cheese cloth.\\n\\nThe soup stock, besides being used for soups, is a necessary ingredient\\nin hundreds of Italian dishes.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Make a paste\\nand knead it well, then let it stand for an hour, wrapped or covered\\nwith a linen cloth. Then spread the paste to a thin sheet, as thin as a\\nten-cent piece.\\n\\nChop and grind pieces of roast or boiled chicken meat: add to it an\\nequal part of marrow from the bones of beef and pieces of brains, three\\nyolks, some crumbs of bread soaked in milk or broth and some grated\\ncheese (Parmesan or Swiss). Rub through a sieve and make little balls as\\nbig as a hazel-nut, which are to be placed at equal distances (a little\\nmore than an inch) in a line over the sheet of paste.\\n\\nBeat a whole egg and pass it over the paste with a brush all around the\\nlittle balls. Cover these with another sheet of paste, press down the\\nintervals between each ball, and then separate each section from the\\nother with a knife. Moisten the edges of each section with the finger\\ndipped in cold water, to make them stick together, and press them down\\nwith the fingers or the prongs of a fork. Then put to boil in water\\nseasoned with salt or, better still, in broth. The ravioli are then to\\nbe served hot seasoned with cheese and butter or with brown stock or\\ntomato sauce.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

After a few hours dip\\nin flour and frying oil.\\n\\nTake a fireproof vase or baking tin and place the slices in layers, with\\ngrated cheese between each layer, abundantly seasoned with tomato sauce\\n(No. 12).\\n\\nBeat one egg with a pinch of salt, a tablespoonful of tomato sauce, a\\nteaspoonful of grated cheese and two of crumbs of bread, and cover the\\nupper layer with this sauce. Put the vase in the oven and when the egg\\nis coagulated, serve hot.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '103': '\\nDRESSING OF CELERY\\n\\n(Sedano per contorno)\\n\\nThe following are three ways to prepare celery to be served as seasoning\\nor seasoning for meat dishes. For the first two make the pieces about\\nfour inches long, and two inches for the third. The stalk must be\\nskinned, cut crosswise and left attached to the rib of the celery. Boil\\nit in water moderately salted not over five minutes and remove dry.\\n\\n1. Put the celery to brown in butter, then complete the cooking with\\nbrown stock (No. 13) and sprinkle with grated cheese when serving.\\n\\n2. Put in saucepan a piece of butter and a hash made with ham and a\\nmiddle sized onion, chopped fine. Add two cloves and make it boil. When\\nthe onion is browned add soup stock or hot water with bouillon cubes and\\ncomplete the cooking. Then rub everything through a sieve and put the\\ngravy in a plate with the celery, seasoning with pepper only, as the\\nsalt is already in the ham and serve with the gravy.\\n\\n3. Dip the celery in flour and in the paste for frying (No. 58) and fry\\nin fat or oil. Or else dip in flour and then in beaten egg, wrap in\\nbread crumbs and fry.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '104': '\\nARTICHOKES WITH SAUCE\\n\\n(Carciofi in salsa)\\n\\nRemove the hard leaves of the artichokes, cut the points and skin the\\nstalk. Divide each artichoke into four parts or six if they are big, and\\nput them on the fire with butter in proportion, seasoning with salt and\\npepper. Shake the saucepan to turn them and when they have absorbed a\\ngood part of the melted butter, pour in some broth to complete the\\ncooking. Remove them dry, and in the gravy that remains put a pinch of\\nchopped parsley, one or two teaspoonfuls of cheese grated fine, lemon\\njuice, more salt and pepper if needed, and, mixing the whole, make it\\nsimmer for a while. Then remove the sauce from the fire and add one or\\ntwo yolks of egg, according to the quantity and put back on the fire\\nwith more broth to make the sauce loose. Put the artichokes in the sauce\\nthis second time to heat them and serve especially as a side-dish for\\nboiled meat.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Then cut the top and open the internal leaves so that you\\ncan cut the bottom with a small knife and remove the hairy part if it is\\nthere. Keep aside the small interior leaves to put them with the\\nstuffing. This, if to be used, for example, for six artichokes, must be\\ncomposed of the above small leaves, 1/8 lb. of ham more lean than fat,\\none fourth of a small onion, just a taste of garlic, some leaves of\\ncelery or parsley, a pinch of dry mushrooms, softened in water, a crumb\\nof bread and a pinch of pepper, but no salt.\\n\\nFirst chop the ham, then grind everything together and with the hash\\nfill the artichokes, and put them to cook standing on their stalks in a\\nsaucepan with some oil, salt and pepper. Some prefer to give the\\nartichokes a half cooking in water before stuffing it, but it is hardly\\nadvisable, because in this way they lose part of their special flavor.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '106': '\\nARTICHOKES STUFFED WITH MEAT\\n\\n(Carciofi ripieni di carne)\\n\\nFor six artichokes, make the following stuffing:\\n\\n  1/4 lb. lean veal.\\n  Two slices of ham, more fat than lean.\\n  The interior part of the artichokes.\\n  One fourth of onion (small).\\n  Some leaves of parsley.\\n  One pinch of softened dried mushrooms.\\n  One small crumb of bread rolled and sifted.\\n  One pinch of grated cheese.\\n\\nWhen the artichokes have been browned with oil alone, pour a little\\nwater and cover with a moistened cloth kept in place by the cover. The\\nsteam that surrounds the artichokes cooks them better.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " '107': '\\nPEAS WITH ONION SAUCE\\n\\n(Piselli alla francese)\\n\\nThe following recipe is good for one of fresh peas. Take two young\\nonions, cut them in half, put some stems of parsley in the middle and\\ntie them.

Choose young mushrooms\\nmiddle sized or big, but not too soft. Scrape the stem, clean them well\\nin order to remove the earth and, without washing cut them in big\\npieces. This because when dried they diminish considerably in size. Keep\\nthese pieces exposed in the sun for two or three days, then thread them\\non a string (practising a hole in them) and keep in a well ventilated\\nroom or in the sun until they become quite dry. Then put them away well\\nclosed in a paper bag, but don't fail to look at them from time to time\\nto see if it is necessary to expose them some more to sun and\\nventilation.\\n\\nTo use them soften in warm water, but keep them in as little as\\npossible, so that they do not lose their delicate flavor. The best time\\nto dry the mushrooms is June or July.\\n\\n\\n\"}"
