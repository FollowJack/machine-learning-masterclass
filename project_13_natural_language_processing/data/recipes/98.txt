STEWED MUSHROOMS

(Funghi in umido)

For a stew the mushrooms ought to be below middle-size. Clean, wash and
cut as for the preceding. Put a saucepan on the fire with olive oil, one
or two cloves of oil and some mint leaves. When the oil begins to
splutter, put the mushrooms in without dipping in flour, season with
salt and pepper and when they are half cooked pour in some tomato sauce.
Be sparing however, with the seasoning, in order that the mushrooms do
not absorb it too much and so lose some of their own delicate flavor.
