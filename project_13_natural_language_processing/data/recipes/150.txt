VEAL KIDNEY WITH ANCHOVY

(Rognone alle acciughe)

Take a veal kidney, remove the fat, cut it open and cover with boiling
water. When the water has cooled, remove the kidney, wipe with a cloth,
and pass through it clean sticks to make it stay open. Season with
melted butter, salt and pepper and leave it so prepared for an hour or
two.

Then take another piece of butter and two or three anchovies. Clean the
latter, chop and mix with the butter with the blade of a knife, making a
ball. Cook the kidney on the grill, but not too much, in order to keep
it tender, put it on a plate and grease when hot with the ball of butter
and anchovies.
