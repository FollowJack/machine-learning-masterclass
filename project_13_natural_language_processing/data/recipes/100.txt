FRIED EGG-PLANTS

(Melanzane fritte)

Egg-plant or, as they are also called, mad-apples are an excellent
vegetable which may be used as dressing or as a dish by itself. Small or
middle-sized egg-plants are to be preferred, as the big ones have
sometimes a slightly bitter taste.

Remove the skin, cut into cubes, salt and leave them in a plate for a
few hours. Then wipe them to remove the juice that they have thrown out,
dip in flour and fry in oil.
