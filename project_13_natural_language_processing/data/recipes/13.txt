BROWN STOCK

(Sugo di Carne)

Cover the bottom of a saucepan with thin slices of beef taken from a
juicy cut and small pieces of salt pork. Place over a large onion, one
carrot, and a stalk of celery, all chopped in small pieces. Add some
butter and cover the whole with any trimmings from steaks or roasts and
any bit of left over cooked meat. Season with salt and cloves. Put over
the fire without stirring. When you smell the onions getting very brown,
turn the meat and when everything is quite brown add a cup of water,
renewing the latter three times. Finally add a certain quantity of
boiling water or, better still, of broth, and let it boil gently five or
six hours. Strain, cool and skim off the fat which will form a cake on
top of the liquid.

The meat can be used afterward for meat balls or =Croquettes=. The stock
may be kept for some days and forms the basis for many dishes.
