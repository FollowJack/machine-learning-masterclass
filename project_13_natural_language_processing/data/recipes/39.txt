STEWED VEAL

(Stracotto di vitella)

The stock from this dish may very well be used to season macaroni or
boiled rice. Care must be taken, however, not to draw away all the
juice of the meat in order to have a sauce too rich at the expense of
the principal dish.

Place in a saucepan one pound of veal or more, bone included, a piece of
butter or some olive oil (or the two together) half a medium sized
onion, one small carrot, two celery stalks cut in small pieces. Season
with salt and pepper. Put it on a low fire, turn the meat over often and
when browned add a pinch of flour and some tomato paste, bringing it to
full cooking with water poured little by little. The flour is used to
keep the sauce together and give it color, but care must be taken not to
burn it, because in that case the sauce would have an unpleasant taste
and a black, instead of a reddish color. The addition of dried
mushrooms, previously softened in the water and slightly boiled in the
sauce will add greatly to its taste.

As has been said the sauce can well be used to season spaghetti or
risotto. The stewed veal can be served with some vegetable.
