DRESSING OF CELERY

(Sedano per contorno)

The following are three ways to prepare celery to be served as seasoning
or seasoning for meat dishes. For the first two make the pieces about
four inches long, and two inches for the third. The stalk must be
skinned, cut crosswise and left attached to the rib of the celery. Boil
it in water moderately salted not over five minutes and remove dry.

1. Put the celery to brown in butter, then complete the cooking with
brown stock (No. 13) and sprinkle with grated cheese when serving.

2. Put in saucepan a piece of butter and a hash made with ham and a
middle sized onion, chopped fine. Add two cloves and make it boil. When
the onion is browned add soup stock or hot water with bouillon cubes and
complete the cooking. Then rub everything through a sieve and put the
gravy in a plate with the celery, seasoning with pepper only, as the
salt is already in the ham and serve with the gravy.

3. Dip the celery in flour and in the paste for frying (No. 58) and fry
in fat or oil. Or else dip in flour and then in beaten egg, wrap in
bread crumbs and fry.
