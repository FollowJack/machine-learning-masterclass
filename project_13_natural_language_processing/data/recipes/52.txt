STEWED RABBIT

(Coniglio in umido)

After washing the rabbit, cut it in rather large pieces and put it on
the fire to drive away the water that is to be drained. When quite dry,
put in the saucepan a piece of butter, a little oil, and a hash
composed of the liver of the rabbit itself, a small piece of corned beef
and some onion, celery, carrot and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.
Stir often and when it is browned add some tomato sauce and another
piece of butter.
