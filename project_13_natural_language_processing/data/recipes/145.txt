TURKEY

(Tacchino)

The turkey has been imported to Europe from America, but it is
nevertheless a well known dish in Italian families, although not
enjoying the popularity that it has on this side of the ocean. When
roasted it is generally larded moderately with little pieces of garlic
and bay-leaf or rosemary and seasoned with a hash of corned beef or
bacon, a little butter, salt and pepper, tomato sauce or tomato paste
diluted in water. The breast, flattened until it is about half an inch
thick and seasoned generously some hours before cooking with oil, salt
and pepper, is excellent broiled on the grill.
