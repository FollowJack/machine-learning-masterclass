POT ROAST LARDED

(Arrosto morto lardellato)

Take a piece short and thick of beef or veal, quite tender and weighing
about two pounds or a little more. Lard it with ham or bacon cut in
little pieces. Tie with a string and put it in a stewpan with a piece of
butter, one fourth of a middle-sized onion cut in two pieces, three or
four ribs of celery half an inch thick and as many slices of carrot.
Season with salt and pepper and when the meat begins to brown--turning
it often--pour over one cup of water and complete the cooking on a low
fire, leaving it to absorb great part of the gravy. See, however, that
it doesn't dry up and become black. When you send to the table strain
the juice that has remained and pour it on the meat, that may be
surrounded with potatoes cut in pieces or kept whole if small,
previously browned in butter or oil.
