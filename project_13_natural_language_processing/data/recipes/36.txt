CORN MEAL WITH SAUSAGES

(Polenta con salsicce)

Cook in water one cup of yellow cornmeal making a stiff mush. Salt it
well and when it is cooked spread out to cool on a bread board about
half an inch thick. Then cut the mush into small squares.

Put in a saucepan several whole sausages with a little water, and when
they are cooked skin and crush them and add some brown stock or tomato
sauce.

Put the polenta (or cornmeal mush) in a fireproof receptacle, season
with grated cheese, the crushed sausages and a piece of butter. Put it
in the oven and serve when hot.
