EGGS WITH HAM

(Uova al prosciutto)

Place in a frying pan as many pieces of butter, large like a nut, as
there are eggs to be cooked. For each piece of butter put a little slice
of ham and place the frying pan on the fire. As soon as the butter is
melted break an egg on each slice of ham. Let cook for ten minutes on a
moderate fire.
