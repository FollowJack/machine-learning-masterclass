YELLOW SAUCE

(Salsa gialla)

This sauce is especially good for boiled fish, and the quantities
indicated below are sufficient for a piece of fish or a whole fish
weighing about a pound.

Put on the fire in a little saucepan one teaspoonful of flour and two
ounces of butter, and when the flour begins to be browned, pour over it
little by little one cup of the broth of the fish, that is to say of the
water in which the fish has been boiled. When you see that the flour
does not rise in the boiling water, take away the sauce from the flour
and pour over two tablespoonfuls of olive oil and the yolk of an egg,
stirring and mixing everything well. Squeeze in the sauce half a lemon
and season generously with salt and pepper. Let it cool and then pour
over the fish that is to be served with a sprig of parsley.

This sauce must have the appearance of a cream and must not be too
liquid, in order that it may remain attached to the fish.
