MACARONI "AU GRATIN"

(Maccheroni al gratin)

Boil the macaroni in salted water until tender and drain them. Butter
slightly a fireproof casserole and lay on the bottom some grated cheese
and grated bread. Alternate the layers of cheese with macaroni and on
the top layer of macaroni put more cheese and bread grated. Over the
whole pour some melted butter, cover the casserole, (or =pyrex= plate)
and put it in the oven with a low fire. Keep for ten minutes or more,
until the top appears browned.
