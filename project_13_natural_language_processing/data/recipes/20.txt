MACARONI NAPOLITAINE

(Maccheroni alla Napoletana)

Grind 1/4 lb. salt pork or bacon and fry it out in a saucepan. While it
is frying put one small onion through the grinder. As soon as the pork
begins to brown add the onion, the parsley chopped, a clove (or small
section) of garlic shredded fine, and a few dried mushrooms which have
been softened by soaking in warm water. When the vegetables are very
brown (great care must be taken not to burn the onion, which scorches
very easily) add 1/2 lb. round steak ground coarsely or cut up in little
cubes. When the meat is a good brown color, add some fresh or canned
tomatoes or half a tablespoonful of tomato paste and simmer slowly until
all has cooked down to a thick creamy sauce. It will probably take 3/4
hour. The sauce may be bound together with a little flour if it shows a
tendency to separate.

This sauce is used to dress all kinds of macaroni and spaghetti, also
for boiled rice (see Risotto). The macaroni or spaghetti should be left
unbroken when cooked. If they are too long to fit in the kettle immerse
one end in the boiling salted water and in a very few minutes the ends
of the spaghetti under the water will become softened so that the rest
can be pushed down into the kettle. Be careful not to overcook it, and
it will not be pasty, but firm and tender. Drain it carefully and put in
a hot soup tureen. Sprinkle a handful of grated cheese over it and pour
on the sauce. Lift with two forks until thoroughly mixed.
