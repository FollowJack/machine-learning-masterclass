LAMB OMELET

(Agnello in frittata)

Cut in little pieces a loin of lamb, which is the part that lends itself
best for this dish, and fry in lard: a little quantity of lard is
sufficient, because the meat of the loins is rather fat. When half
cooked season with salt and pepper and when fully cooked pour over four
or five whole eggs slightly beaten also seasoned moderately with salt
and pepper. Mix, taking care that the eggs do not harden.
