PUDDING OF ROASTED ALMONDS

(Budino di mandorle tostate)

  Milk, one quart.
  Sugar, three and a half ounces.
  Sweet almonds, two ounces.
  Lady-finger biscuits, two ounces.
  Three eggs.

First prepare the almonds, that is to say skin them in warm water and
toast them on the fire over a plate of iron or a stone, then grind very
fine. Boil the sugar and the lady-fingers, broken in little pieces in
the milk, mixing well. After half an hour of boiling, keeping always
stirred, rub the mixture through a sieve. Then add the toasted and
ground almonds. When it is cold add the beaten eggs, pour it in a smooth
mold, whose bottom will be covered with a film of liquified sugar and
cook in a double boiler, that is to say put the mold well closed in a
kettle full of boiling water.

When cooked let it cool and place in ice-box before serving.
