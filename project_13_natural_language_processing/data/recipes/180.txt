EGGS WITH TOMATO SAUCE

(Uova al pomidoro)

Prepare some hard boiled eggs, cut them through the middle lengthwise,
place in good order upon a plate and pour some good tomato sauce, taking
care not to cover the upper part of the eggs, which must emerge from the
sauce.

Instead of the tomato, the eggs may be arranged with a =balsamella=
sauce (No. 54).
