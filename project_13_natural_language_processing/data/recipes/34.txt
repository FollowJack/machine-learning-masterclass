FRIED CHICKEN

(Pollo fritto)

Wash a spring chicken and keep in boiling water for one minute. Cut into
pieces at the joints, roll them in flour, season with salt and pepper
and dip in two whole beaten eggs. After leaving the pieces of chicken
for half an hour, roll them in bread crumbs, repeating the operation
twice if necessary. Put into a saucepan with boiling oil or fat, seeing
that the pieces of chicken are well browned on both sides. Keep the fire
low. Serve hot with lemon.
