BREAD SOUP

(Panata)

This excellent and nutritious soup is a godsend for using the stale
bread that must never again be thrown away. It is composed of bread
crumbs and grated bread, eggs, grated cheese, nutmeg (in very small
quantity) and salt, all mixed together and put in broth previously
prepared, which must be warm at the moment of the immersion, but not at
the boiling point. Then place it on a low fire and stir gently. Any
vegetable left over may be added.
