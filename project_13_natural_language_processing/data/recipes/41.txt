CHICKEN WITH TOMATOES

(Pollo alla contadina)

Take a young chicken and make some little holes in the skin in which you
will put some sprigs of rosemary and a clove of garlic cut into five or
six pieces. Put it on the fire with chopped lard and season with salt
and pepper inside and outside. When it is well browned on all parts add
tomatoes cut in pieces, taking care to remove previously all the seeds.
Moisten with broth or water. Brown some potatoes in oil, fat or butter,
previously cutting them into sections. When browned dip in the sauce of
the chicken and serve the whole together.
