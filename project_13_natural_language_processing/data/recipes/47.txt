STEWED SQUABS

(Piccioni in umido)

Garnish the squabs with whole sage leaves and place them in a saucepan
over a bed of small slices of ham containing both lean and fat, season
with salt, pepper and olive oil. Place on the fire and when they begin
to be browned, add a piece of butter and complete the cooking by pouring
in some good broth. Before removing from the fire squeeze one lemon over
them and garnish with squares or diamonds of toasted bread. Take care
not to add too much salt on account of the ham and the broth both
containing salt.

=Note=--Many of these dishes, it will be noticed, are made with broth.
When meat broth is not available, it can be prepared with bouillon cubes
or with Liebig or Armour Extracts. It is, however, always preferable to
use broth made with fresh meat.
