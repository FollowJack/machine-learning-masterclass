BEEF TONGUE WITH OLIVES

(Lingua di bue alle olive)

Scald the tongue and peel off the skin. Then put it back to boil until
fully cooked.

Melt a piece of butter and brown half a medium sized onion cut in
slices. When the onion is browned remove it from the butter and dilute
in the latter a teaspoonful of flour. When the flour begins to brown,
thin it with one or two cups of soup stock hot and passed through a
sieve. Mix and boil for ten minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper.

When the sauce is prepared place the tongue in the saucepan containing
it and let it cook again on a low fire for about an hour, turning it
over frequently and keeping it moistened with the gravy. Cut some olives
in a spiral to remove the stone and place it in the saucepan with the
tongue. This becomes more tasty if left with the olives for one or two
days.
