CHICKEN WITH SAUCE PIQUANTE

(Pollo al diavolo)

This ought to be cooked with Cayenne pepper and served with a highly
seasoned sauce, but not everybody likes that and a simpler way to cook
the chicken "al diavolo" is the following:

Take a young chicken, remove the neck and the legs, open it all in front
and flatten it open as much as possible. Wash and wipe dry with a towel,
then put it on the grill and when it begins to brown turn it. Grease it
with melted butter or with oil, using a brush, and season with salt and
pepper. The later may be Cayenne pepper for those who like it. Keep
turning and greasing until it is all cooked.

To prepare the sauce piquante that many like with chicken broiled in
this way, put four tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan and when it
begins to brown add two tablespoonfuls of flour and stir until it is
well browned, but do not let it burn. Draw to a cooler place on the
range and slowly add two cupfuls of brown stock, stirring constantly,
add salt and a dash of Cayenne and let simmer for ten minutes. In
another saucepan boil four tablespoonfuls of vinegar one tablespoonful
of chopped onion, one teaspoonful of sugar rapidly for five minutes;
then add it to the sauce and at the same time add one tablespoonful of
chopped capers two tablespoonfuls of chopped pickle and one teaspoonful
of tarragon vinegar. Stir well and let cook for two minutes to heat the
pickles. If the sauce becomes too thick dilute it with a little water.

This sauce is excellent for baked fish and all roasts and boiled meats,
besides being a fitting condiment for the chicken "al diavolo".
