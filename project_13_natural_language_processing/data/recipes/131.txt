POT ROAST WITH GARLIC AND ROSEMARY

(Arrosto morto coll'odore dell'aglio e del ramerino)

Cook the meat as above, but add a clove of garlic and one or two bunches
of rosemary in the saucepan. When serving the roast rub the gravy
through a sieve without pressing and surround the meat with potatoes or
vegetables cooked apart.

The leg of lamb comes very well in this way, baked in the oven.
