VEAL CUTLETS STEWED

(Scaloppine alla Genovese)

Cut some lean veal meat into slices and, supposing it be a pound or a
little more, without bones, chop one fourth of a middle-sized onion and
put it in a saucepan with oil and a little piece of butter. Put over the
cutlets, one layer over the other, season with salt and butter and put
on the fire. When the meat which is below is browned put in a
teaspoonful of flour and after a while a hash of parsley with half a
clove of garlic. Then detach the cutlets the one from the other, mix
them, let them drink in the sauce, then pour hot water and a little
tomato sauce. Make it boil slowly and not much to complete the cooking
and serve with abundant sauce and with little diamonds of toast.
