SQUAB TIMBALE

(Timballo di piccioni)

Chop together some ham, onion, celery and carrot, add a piece of butter
and place on the fire with one or two squabs, according to the number of
guests. Add the giblets from the squabs and some more of chicken, if at
hand. Season with salt and pepper, and when the pigeons are browned,
pour over some broth to complete the cooking, taking care, however, that
the sauce does not become too liquid. Remove the latter and place in it
some macaroni that has been half cooked and drained. Keep the macaroni
in the sauce on the fire, stirring them. Make a well reduced Béchamel
sauce, then cut the squabs at the joints, removing the neck, the legs
and the bones of the back, when you would not bone them entirely, which
would be better. Cut the giblets in small pieces and remove the soft
part of the onion.

When the macaroni have absorbed the sauce, season them with grated
cheese, pieces of butter, diamonds or squares of ham, a taste of nutmeg
and some truffles or dry mushrooms previously softened in water. Add
finally the Béchamel sauce and mix the whole.

Take a sufficiently large mold, butter it and line it with soft pastry.
Put everything in the mold, or timbale, cover it with the same pastry
and put in the oven. Take out of the mold and serve hot. Three quarters
of a pound of macaroni and two pigeons are enough for ten persons.
