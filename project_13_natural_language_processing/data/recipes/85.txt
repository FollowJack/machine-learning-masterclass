TENDERLOIN WITH MARSALA

(Filetto al marsala)

Roll a piece of the tenderloin, tie it and, if it is about two pounds,
put it on the fire with a middle-sized onion cut in thin slices, some
thin slices of ham and a piece of butter, seasoning but moderately with
salt and pepper. When it is browned from all sides and the onion is
consumed, sprinkle a pinch of flour, let this take color and then pour
some soup stock or water. Make it simmer on a low fire, then rub the
gravy through a sieve, skim off the fat and with this and half a small
tumbler of Marsala or Sherry wine put it back on the fire to simmer
again. Serve with the gravy neither too liquid nor too thick.

The filet can also be larded with bacon and cooked in butter and Marsala
only.
