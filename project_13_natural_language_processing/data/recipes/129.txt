ROAST VEAL

(Arrosto di vitella)

Choose for that milk veal that is to be found all the year round,
although it is always better during the spring or summer.

The piece or pieces of veal can be cooked in a saucepan, slightly larded
with garlic and rosemary, with oil, butter and a hash of corned beef,
salt, pepper and tomato sauce. In the gravy fresh peas can be cooked.
