MEAT GENOVESE

(Carne alla Genovese)

Take thick slices of good lean veal, weighing about a pound, beat it and
flatten it well. Beat three or four eggs, season them with salt and
pepper, a pinch of grated cheese and some chopped parsley. Fry the eggs
in butter in the form of an omelet about the size of the meat over
which it will be laid, cutting it where it overlaps and putting the
pieces where it lacks so as to cover the meat entirely. After that roll
tight the meat together with the omelet and tie it with thread. Then
sprinkle some flour over it and put it in a saucepan with a piece of
butter, seasoning with salt and pepper. When it is well browned on all
sides, pour some soup stock to complete the cooking and serve it in its
gravy which will be thick enough on account of the flour.
