TROUT LOMBARD

(Trota fritta)

Clean, scale, wash and wipe the trout. Salt and leave for half an hour.
Fill with water half a fish-kettle; add half a lemon, two bay-leaves,
one carrot light or ten berries of pepper, one onion divided into four
parts, salt and three cloves. When the water is lukewarm, dip in the
trout. Cook on a moderate fire and serve the trout with parsley, slices
of lemon and young potatoes boiled. A good fish-sauce ought to accompany
it.
