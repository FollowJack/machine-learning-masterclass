STEWED ONIONS

(Cipolle in stufato)

Keep in cold water, for half an hour, two pounds of middle-sized onions.
Afterward skin and place in a saucepan in which pour as much broth as is
necessary to cover them. Let them cook on a low fire for an hour, if
they are scallions, or young onions. If they are not, two hours are not
enough, sometimes.

When cooked and soft, drain and place in a large deep dish. Brown a
piece of butter with a tablespoonful of flour, a cup of broth, salt and
pepper. Mix everything and when it begins to boil pour the sauce on the
onions, which must be served hot.
