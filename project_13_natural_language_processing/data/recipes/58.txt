GENOVESE SAUCE

(Salsa genovese)

Chop fine a sprig of parsley and half a clove of garlic. Then mix with
some capers soaked in vinegar, one anchovy, one hard yolk of egg, three
pitless olives, a crumb of bread as big as an egg, soaked in vinegar.
Grind all these ingredients, rub through a sieve and dissolve in olive
oil, dosing right by tasting.
