ALMOND CAKE

(Bocca di dama)

  Granulated sugar, nine ounces,
  Very fine Hungarian flour, five ounces,
  Sweet almonds with some bitter ones, two ounces,
  Six whole eggs and three egg yolks,
  Taste of lemon peel.

After skinning the almonds in warm water and drying them well, grind or
better pound them well together with a tablespoonful of sugar and mix
well with the flour. Put the rest of the sugar in a deep dish with the
egg yolks and the grated lemon peel (just a taste) and stir with a ladle
for a quarter of an hour. In another dish beat the six whites of egg and
when they have become quite thick mix them with other ingredients
stirring slowly everything together.

To bake place the mixture in a baking-tin greased evenly with butter and
sprinkled with powdered sugar and flour.
