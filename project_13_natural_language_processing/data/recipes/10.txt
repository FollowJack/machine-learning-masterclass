RAVIOLI

Put on the bread board about two pounds of flour in a heap; make a
hollow in the middle and put in it a piece of butter, three egg-yolks,
salt and three or four tablespoonfuls of lukewarm water. Make a paste
and knead it well, then let it stand for an hour, wrapped or covered
with a linen cloth. Then spread the paste to a thin sheet, as thin as a
ten-cent piece.

Chop and grind pieces of roast or boiled chicken meat: add to it an
equal part of marrow from the bones of beef and pieces of brains, three
yolks, some crumbs of bread soaked in milk or broth and some grated
cheese (Parmesan or Swiss). Rub through a sieve and make little balls as
big as a hazel-nut, which are to be placed at equal distances (a little
more than an inch) in a line over the sheet of paste.

Beat a whole egg and pass it over the paste with a brush all around the
little balls. Cover these with another sheet of paste, press down the
intervals between each ball, and then separate each section from the
other with a knife. Moisten the edges of each section with the finger
dipped in cold water, to make them stick together, and press them down
with the fingers or the prongs of a fork. Then put to boil in water
seasoned with salt or, better still, in broth. The ravioli are then to
be served hot seasoned with cheese and butter or with brown stock or
tomato sauce.
