MACAROONS

(Amaretti)

I

  Granulated sugar, nine ounces.
  Sweet almonds, three and a half ounces.
  Bitter almonds, half of the above quantity.
  Whites of egg, two.

Skin and dry the almonds, then chop them very fine. Mix the sugar and
the whites of egg and stir for about half an hour, then add the almonds
to form a rather hard paste. Of this make little balls, as large as a
small walnut. If the paste is too soft add a little butter, if too hard
add a little white of egg, this time beaten. Were it desired to give the
macaroons a brownish color, mix with the paste a little burnt sugar.

As you form the little ball, that you will flatten to the thickness of
one third of an inch, put them over wafers or on pieces of paper or in a
baking tin greased with butter and sprinkled with half flour and half
powdered sugar. Dispose them at a certain distance from one another as
they will enlarge and swell, remaining empty inside.

Bake in an oven moderately hot.

II

  Powdered sugar, ten and a half ounces.
  Sweet almonds, three ounces.
  Bitter almonds, one ounce.
  Two whites of egg.

Skin the almonds and dry them in the sun or on the fire, then chop and
grind very fine with one white of egg poured in various times. When this
is done, put half of the sugar, stirring and kneading with your hand.
Then pour everything in a large bowl and, always mixing, add half of the
other white of egg, then the other half of the sugar and finally the
other half of the white.

In this way an homogenous mixture will be obtained of the right
firmness. Shake into a kind of a stick and cut it in rounds all equal,
one third of an inch thick. Take them up one by one with moistened
fingers and make little balls as large as a walnut. Flatten them to the
thickness of a third of an inch and for the rest proceed as said above,
but dust with powdered sugar before putting in a hot oven.

With this dose about thirty macarons can be obtained.
