BROILED MUTTON KIDNEY

(Rognone di montone alla graticola)

After washing the kidneys, remove the filmy skin that covers them and
cut them in the middle without, however, detaching completely the two
parts. Season with salt and pepper, grease with oil and put them on a
strong fire on the grill. After ten or twelve minutes they will be
broiled. Serve hot with parsley and slices of lemon.
