TROUT WITH ANCHOVIES

(Trota alle acciughe)

Scale, clean wash and wipe the trouts. Cut the sides and place to pickle
with salt, pepper berries, garlic, parsley and onions chopped fine; with
mushrooms chopped fine with thyme, bay-leaf and mint, all seasoned with
good olive oil. Rub the pickled pieces at the sieve and place it and
the trout in a baking-tin. Bake in the oven and serve with anchovy
sauce (No. 17).
