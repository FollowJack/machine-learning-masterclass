CHICKEN STUFFING

(Ripieno di pollo)

The ingredients are 1/4 lb. lean veal or pork or breast of turkey and
chicken giblets. Cook this meat together with a little hash of onion,
parsley, celery, carrot and butter. Season with salt pepper and spices,
moistening it with broth. Take dry from the fire, take off the soft
parts of the giblets, add a few dry mushrooms softened in water, a
little slice of lean fat ham and chop everything fine. Into the sauce
that has remained from the cooking throw enough breadcrumbs to make a
tablespoonful of hard soaked bread. Mix it with the chopped hash, add a
pinch of grated cheese and two eggs and fill the chicken with all this,
sewing up the opening afterwards. The chicken can be boiled or stewed.
If boiled you will have an excellent bouillon, but pay attention when
cutting the chicken to extract the stuffing in one piece in order to
slice it.
