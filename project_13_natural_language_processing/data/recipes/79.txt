SHOULDER OF LAMB

(Spalla d'agnello)

Cut the meat of a shoulder of lamb in small pieces, or squares. Chop two
small onions, brown them with a piece of butter and when they are
browned put the meat and season with salt and pepper. Wait until the
meat begins to brown and then add another piece of butter dipped in
flour. Mix the whole and complete the cooking with soup stock or water
with bouillon cubes poured in little by little.
