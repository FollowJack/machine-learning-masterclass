FRIED CROQUETTES, BOLOGNA STYLE

(Fritto composto alla Bolognese)

Take a piece of stewed lean veal, a little brain boiled or stewed, and a
slice of ham. Chop and grind everything fine. Add a yolk of egg or a
whole egg, according to the quantity, and a little =Balsamella= (see No.
54). Put the hash on the fire and stir until the egg is cooked. Add
finally grated cheese, a taste of nutmeg, and, if you have them, some
truffles chopped very fine and put in a plate. When quite cold make some
little balls as large as a walnut and roll them in flour. Then dip in
beaten egg and bread crumb ground very fine, repeating the operation
twice, and fry.
