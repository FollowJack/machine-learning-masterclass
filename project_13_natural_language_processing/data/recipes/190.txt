CORN MEAL CAKES

(Pasta di farina gialla)

  Corn meal, seven and a half ounces,
  Wheat flour, five and a half ounces,
  Granulated sugar, five and a half ounces,
  Butter, three and a half ounces,
  Lard, two ounces,
  A pinch of anise seed,
  One egg.

Mix together the corn meal, the flour and the anise seed and knead with
the butter, the lard and the egg that quantity that you can, forming a
loaf that you will put aside. What remains is to be kneaded with water
forming another loaf. Then mix the two loaves and knead a little, not
much because the dough must remain soft. Flatten with the rolling pin
until it becomes one quarter of an inch thick, sprinkle with flour, and
cut in different sizes and shapes with thin stamps.

Grease a baking tin with lard, sprinkle, with flour, glaze with the egg,
bake and dust with powdered sugar.
