STEWED CUTLETS

(Scaloppine alla Livornese)

Take some slices of tender beef, beat them well and put them in a
saucepan with a piece of butter. When this is all melted, put one or two
tablespoonfuls of broth to complete the cooking, season with salt and
pepper, add a pinch of flour and before taking them from the fire put
in a pinch of chopped parsley.
