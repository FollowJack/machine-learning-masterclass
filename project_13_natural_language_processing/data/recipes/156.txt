STEWED BEEF TONGUE

(Lingua di bue in stufato)

Clean a fresh tongue of beef; put it in a plate, salt it generously and
put it back in the ice-box or in the pantry, until the following day.

After twenty-four hours, scald it in boiling water, skin and lard with
little pieces of bacon and put it in a kettle or a large saucepan in
which the seasoning is already placed. This seasoning consists of 1/2
lb. bacon cut in very thin slices, 1/4 lb. butter, one or two thin
slices of ham and two middle sized onions, sliced. Sprinkle the tongue
with flour, surround it with chopped meat and place the saucepan on the
fire. When the tongue begins to brown, pour five or six cups of soup
stock and one cup of water. Add the usual bunch of greens, two or three
cloves, salt, a pinch of pepper and one of cinnamon.

Cover the saucepan tightly, boil for about four hours, rub the sauce
through a sieve and serve everything hot.
