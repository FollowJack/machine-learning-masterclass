GNOCCHI

This is an excellent soup, but as it requires boiled or roast breast of
chicken or turkey it is well to make it only when these ingredients are
handy.

Prepare a certain quantity of boiled potatoes, the mealy kind being
preferred. Mash the potatoes and mix them with chicken or turkey breast
well ground, grated cheese (Parmesan or Swiss), two or more yolks of
eggs, salt and a small quantity of nutmeg. Pour the compound on the
bread board with a quantity of flour sufficient to make a paste and roll
it in little sticks as thick as the small finger. Cut the sticks in
little pieces about half an inch long and put them in boiling water.
Five or six minutes' cooking will be sufficient.
