MEAT OMELETTE

(Polpettone)

Take one pound of veal, without bones, clean it well taking away all
skins and tendons and then chop it together with a slice of ham. Season
moderately with salt pepper and spices, add one whole egg then with
moistened hands make a ball of the chopped meat and sprinkle with flour.

Make a hash with two or three slices of onion (not more) parsley,
celery, and carrot, put it on the fire with a piece of butter and when
it is browned throw in the =Polpettone=. Brown well on all sides and
then pour in the saucepan half a tumbler of water in which half a
tablespoonful of flour has been previously diluted. Cover and make it
simmer on a very low fire, seeing that it doesn't burn. When you serve
with the gravy squeeze the juice of half a lemon over it.

If desired a hard boiled egg can be put shelled in the center of the
meat ball, so that it gives it a better appearance when sliced.
