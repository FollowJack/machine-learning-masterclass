MACARONI FRIED WITH OIL

(Maccheroni all'olio)

After the macaroni have boiled drain them and put them in a saucepan in
which some good olive oil has already boiled, with a clove of garlic
chopped fine. Let the paste fry, taking care that it doesn't stick to
the bottom of the saucepan, and when it is well browned on one side,
turn it to have the other side browned. Serve the macaroni very hot. Add
no cheese.
