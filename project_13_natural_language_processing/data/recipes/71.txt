KIDNEY SAUTÃ‰

(Rognoni saltati)

Take one large kidney, or two or three small kidneys, open them and
remove all the fat. Cut lengthwise in thin slices, salt and pour as much
boiling water as is needed to cover them. When the water is thoroughly
cooled, drain it and wipe well the slices with a cloth, then put them in
a frying pan with a small piece of butter. Turn them often and when they
have cooked for five minutes put in a pinch of flour and season with
salt and pepper. Leave them on the fire until thoroughly cooked and when
you are going to take them away add another piece of butter, a sprig of
chopped parsley and a little broth if needed. The kidney must not be
kept too much on the fire, because in that case it hardens.
