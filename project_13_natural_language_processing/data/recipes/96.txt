ARTICHOKES IN MOLD

(Sformato di carciofi)

Remove the outside leaves of the artichokes, the harder part of all
leaves, and clean the stalks without removing them.

Cut each artichoke into four parts and put them to boil in salt water
for only five minutes. If left longer on the fire they become too soaked
in water and lose their taste. Remove from the water, drain them, grind
or pound and rub them through a sieve. Season the pulp so obtained with
two or three beaten eggs, two or three tablespoonfuls of =Balsamella=
(No. 54) grated cheese, salt and a taste of nutmeg, but taste the
seasoning several times to see that it is correctly dosed.

Place in a mold with brown stock or meat gravy (in that case use a mold
with a hole) and cook in double boiler.
