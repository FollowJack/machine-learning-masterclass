CHICKEN WITH SAUSAGES

(Pollo colle salsicce)

Chop fine half an onion and put it in a saucepan with a piece of butter
and four or five slices of ham, half an inch wide. Over these
ingredients place a whole chicken, season with pepper and a little salt
and place on the fire. Brown it on all sides and, when the onion is all
melted, add water or broth and three or four sausages freshly made. Let
it cook on a low fire, seeing that the sauce remains liquid and does not
dry up.
