FRIED MUSHROOMS

(Funghi fritti)

Choose middle-sized mushrooms, which are also of the right ripeness:
when they are too big they are too soft and if small they are too hard.

Scrape the stems, wash them carefully but do not keep in water, for then
they would lose their pleasant odor. Then cut them in rather large
slices and dip them in flour before putting in the frying pan. Olive oil
is best for frying mushrooms and the seasoning is composed exclusively
of salt and pepper to be applied when they are frying. They can also be
dipped in beaten eggs after being sprinkled with flour, but this is
superfluous.
