APRICOT MARMALADE

(Conserva di albicocche)

Use good and ripe apricots. It is a mistake to believe that jam or
marmalade can be obtained with any kind of fruit. Take off the stones,
put them on the fire without water and while they boil, stir with a
ladle to reduce them to pulp. When they have boiled for about half an
hour, rub them through a sieve to separate the pulp of the fruit from
the skins that are to be thrown away, then put them back on the fire
with granulated sugar in the proportion of eight tenths, that is to say
eight pounds of sugar for ten pounds of apricot pulp. Stir often with
the ladle until the mixture acquires the firmness of marmalade, which
will be known by putting from time to time a teaspoonful in a plate and
seeing that it flows slowly.

When ready, remove from the fire, let it cool, and then put in vases
well covered and with a film of paraffine or tissue paper dipped in
alcohol, so that the air may not pass in.
