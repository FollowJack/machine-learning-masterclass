BEEF TONGUE BOILED

(Lingua di bue lessa)

The tongue is boiled like the beef. When half cooked remove the skin,
which is not nice to see and has no nutritious elements, although it is
served with a pur√©e of peas, or spinach or potatoes or beans, etc.
But it can be served simply with sprigs of parsley.
