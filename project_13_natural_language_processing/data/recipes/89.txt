LIVER LOAF

(Pane di fegato)

Cut about one pound of veal liver in thin slices and four chicken livers
in two parts and put all this in a saucepan with rosemary and a piece of
butter. When this is melted put in another piece and season with salt
and pepper. After four or five minutes at a live fire, remove the liver
(dry) and grind it together with the rosemary. In the gravy that remains
in the saucepan put a big crumb of bread, cut into small pieces and make
a paste that will also be ground with the liver. Then rub everything
through a sieve, add one whole egg and two yolks and a pinch of grated
cheese, diluting with brown stock or water. Finally put in a smooth mold
with a sheet of paper in the bottom, all evenly greased with butter and
cook in a double boiler. Remove from the mold when cool and serve cold,
with gelatine.
