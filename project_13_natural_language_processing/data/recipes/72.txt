LEG OF MUTTON IN CASSEROLE

(Cosciotto di castrato in cazzaruola)

Take a shoulder or a leg of mutton and after having boned it, lard it
with small pieces of bacon dipped in salt and pepper. Salt moderately
the meat then tie it tight and put it on the fire in a pan that contains
a piece of butter and one large onion larded with clover. When it begins
to brown, take it away from the fire and add a cup of broth, or of
water, a little bunch of greens and some tomatoes cut in pieces. Put
again on a low fire and let it simmer for three hours, keeping the
saucepan closed, but opening from time to time to turn the meat. When it
is cooked, throw away the onion, rub the sauce through a sieve, remove
its fat and put it with the meat when served. The mutton must not be
overdone, for in this case it cannot be sliced.
