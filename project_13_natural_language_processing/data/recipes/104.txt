ARTICHOKES WITH SAUCE

(Carciofi in salsa)

Remove the hard leaves of the artichokes, cut the points and skin the
stalk. Divide each artichoke into four parts or six if they are big, and
put them on the fire with butter in proportion, seasoning with salt and
pepper. Shake the saucepan to turn them and when they have absorbed a
good part of the melted butter, pour in some broth to complete the
cooking. Remove them dry, and in the gravy that remains put a pinch of
chopped parsley, one or two teaspoonfuls of cheese grated fine, lemon
juice, more salt and pepper if needed, and, mixing the whole, make it
simmer for a while. Then remove the sauce from the fire and add one or
two yolks of egg, according to the quantity and put back on the fire
with more broth to make the sauce loose. Put the artichokes in the sauce
this second time to heat them and serve especially as a side-dish for
boiled meat.
