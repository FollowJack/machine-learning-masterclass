PUDDING GENOESE

(Budino alla genovese)

Chop together a slice of veal, some chicken breast and two slices of ham
and then grind or better pound them, with a small piece of butter, a
tablespoonful of grated cheese and a crumb of bread soaked with milk.
Rub through a sieve and add three tablespoonfuls of =Balsamella= (see
No. 54) which you will make thick enough for this dish, three eggs and
just a taste of nutmeg, mixing everything well.

Take a smooth mold, grease it evenly with butter and put on the bottom a
sheet of paper, cut according to the shape of the bottom and equally
greased with butter. Pour over the above ingredients and cook in a
vessel immersed in boiling water (double boiler).

When taken from the mold, remove the paper and in its place put a gravy
formed with chopped chicken giblets cooked in brown stock. Serve hot.
