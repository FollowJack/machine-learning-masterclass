STEWED DOG-FISH

(Palombo in umido)

Cut the dog-fish in rather big pieces and then make a hash of garlic,
parsley and very little onion. Put this hash on the fire with oil and
when it is sufficiently browned, put the pieces of dog-fish and season
with salt and pepper. When the fish is cooked pour over some tomato
sauce (No. 12), let this simmer for a while, then serve.
