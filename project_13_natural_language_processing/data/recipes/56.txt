SAUCE FOR BROILED FISH

(Salsa per pesce in gratella)

This sauce is composed of yolks of eggs, salted anchovies, olive oil and
lemon juice. Boil the eggs in their shell for ten minutes and for every
hard yolk take one large anchovy or two small. Bone the anchovies and
rub them on the sieve together with the hard (or semi-hard) yolks, and
dissolve all with oil and lemon juice to reduce it like a cream. Cover
with this sauce the broiled fish before sending to the table, or serve
aside in a gravy boat.
