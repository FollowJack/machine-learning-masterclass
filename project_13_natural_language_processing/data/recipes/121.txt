MUSSELS WITH TOMATO SAUCE

(Arselle alla livornese)

Chop fine half an onion and put it on the fire with oil and a pinch of
pepper. When the onion begins to brown add a pinch of parsley chopped
not very fine and after put in the mussels with tomato sauce (No. 12)
or tomato paste diluted in water. Shake them often and when they are
open, put them over slices of toast prepared beforehand and arranged on
a plate.
