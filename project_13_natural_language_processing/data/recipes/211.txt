LEMON SYRUP

(Sciroppo di limone)

  Three big lemons.
  One and a half pound of sugar.
  A tumbler of water.

Skin the lemons, removing the internal pulp without squeezing it and
taking off all seeds.

Put the water on the fire with the skin of one of the lemons cut in a
thin ribbon like strip with a small knife. When the water is near
boiling put in the sugar then remove the lemon skin and immerse the pulp
of the three lemons. Boil until the syrup is condensed and cooked right,
which is known by the pearls that it makes boiling and the color of
white wine that it acquires. Preserve in a bottle, and when needed,
dilute in a tumbler of ice water. A small quantity will make a
delightful beverage.
