STEW

(Stufato)

The Italian =stufato= is somewhat different from the stewed meat that
is known under the name of "Irish stew". It corresponds to the French
=daube= and is prepared in Italy in many different ways.

An excellent =stufato= can be made in the following way: Chop fine two
bunches of parsley, a small carrot, half a medium sized onion, a little
piece of scallion and two bay-leaves. Brown with a good piece of butter
in a saucepan in which one and a half tablespoonful of oil have been
previously poured.

The meat must have been prepared beforehand, that is to say washed,
trimmed and larded. When half cooked, season moderately with salt and
pepper. If necessary, moisten with broth or water. During the cooking
the saucepan must be covered with its cover and with a sheet of paper
greased with fat or oil. The stufato will be ready after about three
hours' cooking on a low fire.
