STRING BEANS WITH EGG SAUCE

(Fagiuolini in salsa d'uovo)

Take less than a pound of string beans, cutting off the two points and
removing all the strings, and then cook them partially in water
moderately salted. Take them from the kettle, drain, and brown with
butter, salt and pepper. Beat one yolk with a teaspoonful of flour and
the juice of half a small lemon, dilute with half a cup of cold broth
from which the fat has been removed and put this liquid on the fire in a
small saucepan stirring continually. When the liquid has become, through
the cooking, like a cream, pour it on the string beans that you will
keep on the fire a little longer, with the sauce. The string beans so
prepared can be served with boiled beef.
