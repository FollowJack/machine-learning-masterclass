VEAL LIVER

(Fegato di vitella alla veneziana)

Brown a large onion cut in thin slices in oil and place in the saucepan
the liver cut in thin slices. Brown everything on a strong fire. When
the liver takes a reddish color it is ready. If it is overdone, it
becomes too hard. Salt just before removing from the saucepan.
