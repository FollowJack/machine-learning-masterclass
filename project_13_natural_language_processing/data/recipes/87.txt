RICE PUDDING WITH GIBLETS

(Sfornato di riso con rigoglie)

Make a good brown stock (see No. 13) and use the same for the rice as
well as for the giblets. To these add some thin slices of ham and brown
them first in butter, seasoned moderately with salt and pepper,
completing the cooking with brown stock. A taste of mushrooms will be
found useful.

Brown the rice equally in butter, then complete the cooking with hot
water. Drain and put the brown stock, adding grated cheese and two
beaten eggs, when the rice has cooled a little.

Take a smooth mold, round or oval, grease it evenly with butter, cover
the bottom with buttered paper and place in it the rice to harden it in
the oven. When taken from the mold pour over the gravy from the
giblets, slightly thickened with a pinch of flour and serve with the
giblets around, seeing that there is plenty of gravy for them.
