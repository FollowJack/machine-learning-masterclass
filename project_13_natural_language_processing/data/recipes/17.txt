MACARONI WITH ANCHOVY SAUCE

(Maccheroni con salsa d'acciughe)

After the paste is drained thoroughly it is to be put into the hot dish
in which it is to be served and the anchovy sauce poured over it and
well mixed with two silver forks until the sauce has gone all through
it. Some olive oil may be added, but grated cheese is not generally used
with the anchovy sauce.
