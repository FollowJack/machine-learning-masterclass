SPAGHETTI OR MACARONI WITH BUTTER AND CHEESE

(Pasta al burro e formaggio)

This is the simplest form in which the spaghetti may be served, and it
is generally reserved for the thickest paste. The spaghetti are to be
boiled until tender in salted water, taking care to remove them when
tender, and not cooked until they lose form. They should not be put into
the water until this is at a boiling point.

Take as much macaroni as will half fill the dish in which it is to be
served. Break into pieces two and a half to three inches long if you so
desire. The Italians leave them unbroken, but their skill in turning
them around the fork and eating them =is not the privilege of
everybody=. Put the macaroni into salted boiling water, and boil twelve
to fifteen minutes, or until the macaroni is perfectly soft. Stir
frequently to prevent the macaroni from adhering to the bottom. Turn it
into a colander to drain; then put it into a pudding-dish with a
generous quantity of butter and grated cheese. If more cheese is liked,
it can be brought to the table so that the guests can help themselves to
it.

The macaroni called "Mezzani" which is a name designating size, not
quality, is the preferable kind for macaroni dishes made with butter and
cheese.
