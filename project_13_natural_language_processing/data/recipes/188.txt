CURLY TART

(Torta ricciolina)

  Sweet almonds with a few bitter ones, four ounces,
  Granulated sugar, six ounces,
  Candied fruits or angelica, 2-1/2 ounces,
  Butter, two ounces,
  Lemon peel.

Mix two eggs with flour, flatten the paste to a thin sheet on a bread
board and cut into thin noodles. In a corner of the bread board make a
heap of the almonds with the sugar, the candied fruit cut in pieces and
the grated lemon peel. All this cut and crush so as to reduce the
mixture in little pieces. Then take a pie-dish and without greasing it,
spread a layer of noodles on the bottom, then pour part of the mixture,
then another layer of noodles and continue until there remains no more
material, trying to have the tart at least one inch thick. When it is so
prepared cover with the melted butter, using a brush to apply it evenly.
