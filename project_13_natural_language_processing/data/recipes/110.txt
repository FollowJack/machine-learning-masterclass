STUFFED TOMATOES

(Pomodori ripieni)

Select ripe middle-sized tomatoes, cut them in two equal parts and scoop
out the inside seeds. Season with salt and pepper and fill the tomatoes
with the following hash, in such a way as to make the stuffing come over
the edge of the half tomato:

Make a hash with onion, parsley and celery, put it on the fire with a
piece of butter and when it is browned, put in a small handful of dried
mushrooms previously softened in water and chopped very fine: add a
tablespoonful of bread crumbs soaked in milk, season with salt and
pepper and let the compound simmer, moistening with water if necessary.
When you take from the fire add, when it is still lukewarm, grated
cheese and a beaten yolk (or two) of egg, but seeing that the compound
does not become too liquid.

When the tomatoes are filled, take them in the oven with a little butter
and oil mixed together and serve them as a side-dish for roast beef or
steak.

The stuffed tomatoes can be made simpler with a hash of garlic and
parsley mixed with bread crumbs, salt and pepper and seasoned with oil
when they are in the saucepan.
