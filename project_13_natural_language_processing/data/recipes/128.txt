ROAST-BEEF

(Arrosto)

Although roast-beef is not an Italian dish, still it is prepared in a
peculiar way by the Italians, and hence this recipe finds its place
here.

To obtain a good roast-beef not less than two pounds ought to be cooked
on a strong fire. It ought to be covered with good olive oil and finally
with cup of soup stock which with the oil and the juice from the meat
will form a rich gravy. Salt it only when it is half cooked and do it
moderately, because the beef is already tasty by itself.

Put it on the fire half an hour before the soup is served and the meal
begins. This will be sufficient if the piece is not very big. To
ascertain the cooking prick it in the bigger part with a thin
larding-pin, but not often, in order not to allow too much juice to
escape. The juice must neither be of the color of the blood nor too
dark.

If baked it is to be seasoned with salt, oil and a piece of butter,
surrounded by raw potatoes peeled. Pour in the kettle a cup of broth or
of water. If you do not like cold roast beef, cut it into slices and
warm with butter and brown stock or tomato sauce.
