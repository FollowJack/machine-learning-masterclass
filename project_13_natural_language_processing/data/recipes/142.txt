CHICKEN SAUTÃ‰

(Pollo saltato)

Take a young chicken, remove the neck and trim the wings. Cut away the
legs. Cut the chicken into six pieces. Remove some of the bones. Beat
an egg with a teaspoonful of water and place in it the pieces of chicken
after dipping them in flour and seasoning generously with salt and
pepper. Leave the pieces in the egg until it is time for cooking. Then
take the pieces one by one, sprinkle with bread crumbs and place a
saucepan with a good piece of butter on the fire. When the butter begins
to brown put in the pieces of chicken from the side of the skin, then
turn them when browned to the other side. Let them on a good fire for
about ten minutes. Serve with lemon. The chicken prepared in this way is
good also when cold.
