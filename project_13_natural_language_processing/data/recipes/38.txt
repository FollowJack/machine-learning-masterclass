STUFFED ROLLS

(Pagnottelle ripiene)

Take some rolls, and by means of a round opening on the top, as large as
a half dollar piece or less, extract nearly all the crumb, leaving the
crust intact, but not too thin. Wet inside and outside with hot milk,
and when they are fairly soaked, dip in beaten eggs and fry them in lard
or oil. When beginning to brown, fill them with meat that has been
previously chopped and cooked. This chopped meat ought to be made with
breast of chicken, chicken giblets, liver etc., brown stock and some
flour to hold it together.
