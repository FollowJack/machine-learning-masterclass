POTATO PUDDING

(Budino di patate)

  Potatoes, big and mealy, one and a half lb.
  Sugar, five and a half ounces.
  Butter, one and a half ounces.
  Flour, a tablespoonful.
  Milk, half a pint.
  Six eggs.
  A pinch of salt.
  Paste of cinnamon or lemon peel.

Boil or steam the potatoes, skin and rub through a sieve. Place them
back again on the fire with the butter, the flour and the milk, all
poured little by little, stirring well with the ladle, then add the
sugar, the salt and the cinnamon or lemon peel (just a taste) and mix
everything together well. Remove from the fire and, when the mixture is
lukewarm or cold add the eggs, first the yolks, then the whites beaten.

Bake like all other puddings and serve hot.
