LAMB WITH PEAS

(Agnello ai piselli)

Take a piece of lamb from the hind side, lard it with two cloves of
garlic cut in little strips and with some sprigs of rosemary. Chop fine
a piece of lard and a slice of corned beef. Put the lamb on the fire
with this hash and a little oil and let it brown after seasoning with
salt and pepper. When it is browned add a piece of butter, some tomato
sauce, or tomato paste dissolved in water or soup stock and complete the
cooking. Take away the lamb, put the peas in the gravy, and when they
have simmered a little and are cooked put back the lamb and serve.
