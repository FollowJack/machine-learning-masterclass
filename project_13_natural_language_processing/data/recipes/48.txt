RAGOUT OF SQUABS

(Manicaretto di piccione)

Cut two or more squabs at the joints, preferably in four parts each, and
put them on the fire with a slice of ham, a piece of butter, and a bunch
of parsley. When they begin to dry, add some broth and--before they are
completely cooked--their giblets and fresh mushrooms cut in slices.
Continue pouring in broth and allow the whole to simmer on a low fire.
Add another piece of butter over which some flour has been sprinkled, or
flour alone. Before serving, remove the ham and the bunch of greens and
squeeze some lemon juice over the squabs.

Some sweetbread may be added with good effect, but it must be first
scalded and the skin removed.
