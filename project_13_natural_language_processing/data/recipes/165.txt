CELERY WITH BUTTER

(Sedano al burro)

Two heads of celery for each person.

Clean and trim, removing the sprigs that are too hard, and the leaves,
that are to be cut where they begin to be green. Finally trim the stem.
Then wash repeatedly in running water, drain and put to boil in salted
boiling water. Remove when cooked and drain again.

About three quarters of an hour before serving, melt a piece of butter
in a saucepan and brown the celery, turning them often for about ten
minutes. After that pour over hot stock (soup stock or chicken broth)
cover the saucepan and parboil. A few moments before serving season with
brown stock, if you have any at hand, otherwise with salt and pepper
only.
