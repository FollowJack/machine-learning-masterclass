POLENTA WITH SAUSAGES

(Polenta colle salsicce)

The polenta is a very popular dish in Northern Italy and can be
prepared in various ways. Always, however, it is better to serve with
the addition of sausages, or with birds or tomato paste.

The =polenta= is practically cornmeal and it is made with the so-called
=farina gialla= or yellow flour.

The ingredients for a good polenta are one pound of corn meal,
preferably granulous, one quart and a half of water, salted in
proportion, one piece of butter, one cup and a half of milk.

Pour the meal little by little into boiling water, continually stirring
with a wooden spoon. When the meal is half cooked, put the butter and
pour the milk little by little. While the =polenta= boils, place on the
fire in a little saucepan a tablespoonful of olive oil or a small piece
of butter. When the oil is hot or the butter is melted, put some
sausages repeatedly pricked with a fork.

When the sausages are cooked, pour the polenta hot in a dish and place
the sausages and the gravy in a cavity practised in the middle. Serve
hot.

In cooking the sausages two or three bay-leaves may be added and removed
before serving.
