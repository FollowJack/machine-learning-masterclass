STEWED ARTICHOKES

(Carciofi in stufato)

Wash the artichokes and cut the hard part of the leaves (the top). Widen
the leaves and insert a hash composed of bread crumbs, parsley, salt,
pepper and oil. Place the artichokes in the saucepan standing on their
stalk, one touching the other. Cover them with water and let them cook
for two hours or more. When the leaves are easily detached they are
cooked.
