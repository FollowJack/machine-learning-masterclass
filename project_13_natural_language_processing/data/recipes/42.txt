CHICKEN WITH SHERRY

(Pollo al marsala)

Cut the chicken in big pieces and put it in the saucepan with one medium
sized onion chopped fine and a piece of butter. Season with salt and
pepper and, when it is well browned, add some broth and complete the
cooking. Remove the excessive fat from the sauce by sifting through a
sieve or otherwise, and put the chicken back on the fire with a glass of
Sherry or Marsala wine, removing it from the fire as soon as the sauce
begins to boil.
