STEWED EEL

(Anguille in umido)

For this dish it is preferable to have good sized eels that must not be
skinned, but cut in small pieces.

Chop some onion and parsley, put it on the fire with oil, salt, and
pepper, and when the onion is browned, add the pieces of eel. Wait until
it has absorbed the taste of the onion sauce and then complete the
cooking with tomato sauce (No. 12).

See that there is plenty of gravy and serve with little squares or
diamonds of toast.
