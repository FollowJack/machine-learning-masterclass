ARTICHOKES WITH BUTTER

(Carciofi al burro)

Wash, dry and cut out the top of the leaves of as many artichokes as are
needed. Cut them in two or four and boil them in salt water. When
tender, drain them, have them slightly browned in melted butter and
season with salt and pepper.

When served in a vegetable dish or placed in a pyramid on a round plate,
sprinkle with grated cheese.
