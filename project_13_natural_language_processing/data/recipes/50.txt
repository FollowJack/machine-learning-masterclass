SALMI OF GAME

(Uccelli in salmi)

Roast the game completely, seasoning with salt and pepper. If the game
be small birds, leave them whole, if big cut them in four parts. Remove
all the heads and grind them together with some pieces of birds, or some
whole little birds. Put in a saucepan one tablespoonful of butter one
half pound of bacon or ham cut into dice, brown stock or broth, one
tablespoonful each of chopped onion and carrot, one tablespoonful each
of salt, thyme and sage. Allow the sauce to simmer for half an hour
then rub it through a sieve and place in it the roasted game. Make it
boil until the cooking is completed and serve with toasted diamonds of
bread.
