MUTTON KIDNEY FRIED

(Granelli di montone fritti)

Wash, remove the skin that covers the kidneys and cut in very thin
slices. Wipe with a cloth, dip first in ground bread crumbs, then in a
beaten egg mixed with melted butter, then again in the bread crumbs.
This must be done rapidly, at the time of frying, otherwise the bread
crumbs absorb the moisture of the kidney and make them too hard.

Melt a piece of butter in a saucepan on a strong fire and when it begins
to brown, dip the slices of kidney. Turn often, sprinkle with a little
parsley chopped fine, salt and serve with lemon.
