WHITING WITH ANCHOVY SAUCE

(Merluzzo alla Palermitana)

Take one whiting, one pound or a little more, and trim all the fins,
leaving the tail and the head. Split it to remove the bone, and season
with a little salt and pepper. Turn it on the back, grease with oil,
season with salt and pepper, dust with bread crumbs then lay it with two
tablespoonfuls of oil on a fireproof plate or baking tin.

Take three or four good sized anchovies, bone and clean them, chop them
and put on the fire with two tablespoonfuls of oil, but do not allow it
to boil. With this sauce cover the back of the fish and dust it all with
bread crumbs, putting also some leaves of rosemary. Bake in the oven,
allowing a little crust to form over, but see that it doesn't dry up,
pouring over to this purpose more oil. Before removing from the tin
squeeze half a lemon over.

This dish can be served surrounded by little toast with caviar, or
anchovies and butter.
