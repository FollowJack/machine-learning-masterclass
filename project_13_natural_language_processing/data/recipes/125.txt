CODFISH CROQUETTES

(Cotolette di baccal√°)

Boil as explained above and, if the quantity is one pound or a little
more put together two anchovies and some parsley, chopping everything
together very fine. Add some pepper, a tablespoonful of grated cheese,
three or four tablespoonfuls of pap, composed of bread crumbs in large
pieces, water and butter, and two eggs. Give the compound the form of
several flat cutlets, dip them in beaten egg and in ground bread crumbs.
Fry in oil and serve with lemon, or tomato sauce.
