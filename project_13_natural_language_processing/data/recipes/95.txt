CAULIFLOWER IN MOLD

(Sformato di cavolfiore)

Take a good sized cauliflower, remove the stalk and outside leaves, half
cook it in water and then cut it into small pieces. Salt them and put
them to brown with a little piece of butter and then complete the
cooking with a cup of milk. Then rub them through a sieve. Prepare a
=Balsamella= (No. 54) and add it to the cauliflower with 3 beaten eggs
and a tablespoonful of grated cheese.

Cook in a greased mold and serve hot.
