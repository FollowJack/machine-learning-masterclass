PAVESE SOUP

(Zuppa alla Pavese)

Cut as many thin slices of bread as are needed in order that each person
may have at least two of them. These slices are then to be toasted and
browned with butter. Poach two eggs for each person, one on each slice
of bread and place the slices on a large and deep dish (not in a soup
tureen). Pour hot broth in the plate, taking care not to break the eggs,
season with Parmesan or Swiss cheese, and serve.
