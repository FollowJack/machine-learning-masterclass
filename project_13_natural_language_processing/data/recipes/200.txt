FARINA TART

(Torta di semolino)

  Milk, one quart.
  Farina finely ground, four and a half ounces.
  Sugar, four and a half ounces.
  Sweet almonds with three bitter, three and a half ounces.
  Butter, a small piece.
  Four eggs.
  Taste of lemon peel.
  A pinch of salt.

Skin the almonds in warm water and ground or pound very fine with all
the sugar, to be mixed one tablespoonful at a time.

Cook the farina in the milk and before removing from the fire add the
butter and the almonds, which will dissolve easily, being mixed with the
sugar. Then put the pinch of salt and wait until it becomes lukewarm to
add the eggs that are to be beaten whole previously. Pour the mixture in
a baking tin greased evenly with butter, sprinkled with bread crumbs and
of such a size that the tart has the thickness of an inch or less. Put
it in the oven, remove from the mold when cold and serve whole or cut
into sections.
