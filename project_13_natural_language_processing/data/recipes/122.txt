CODFISH

(Baccal√°)

I

Freshen and soak the codfish in cold water, changing the water two or
three times, or, better, keeping it for some time in a vase under
running cold water. Then cut it into pieces as large as the palm of the
hand and dip them in flour until they are well covered. Then put a
kettle or a saucepan on the fire with plenty of oil and two or three
cloves of garlic, whole but a little crushed. When the garlic begins to
brown put in the codfish and brown it on both sides, stirring it often,
so that it doesn't burn. Salt is not necessary, or at least only a
little after tasting, but a little pepper will not be amiss. Finally
pour over some tomato sauce (No. 12) or tomato paste diluted in water,
let it boil a little more and serve.
