LEG OF LAMB

(Agnello all'Orientale)

This is a way to cook lamb in use in the Orient and adopted by the
Italians, especially in Southern Italy. The leg of lamb is to be larded
with the larding pin with slices of bacon seasoned with salt and pepper,
greased with butter or milk, or milk alone and salted when half cooked.

The Arabs, who are very fond of this dish, do not lard it, as pork is
forbidden by their religion, but cook it with an abundance of milk.
