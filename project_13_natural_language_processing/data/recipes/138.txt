STUFFED BEEF CUTLET

(Braciuola di manzo ripiena)

The ingredients for this dish are a slice of beef half an inch thick,
weighing about one pound, half a pound or less of lean milk veal, two
small slices of ham and two or three of tongue, one scant tablespoonful
of grated cheese, a piece of butter, two chicken livers, one egg, a
crumb of bread as large as a closed fist.

Make a hash with a small onion, a little celery, carrot and parsley, put
it on the fire with the butter and when it is browned, place in the
saucepan the veal cut in small pieces and the chicken livers, season
with little salt and pepper and complete the cooking with a little
broth. Remove the veal and chicken when cooked, and chop them fine. In
the gravy that remains make a pap rather hard with the crumb of bread,
moistening with broth if necessary. Now mix the chopped meat, the pap,
the eggs, the cheese, the ham and tongue cut in little pieces. When the
stuffing is composed thus, dip the cutlet in water, in order to stretch
it better, beat it with the back of the knife and flatten with its
blades. Put the stuffing inside and roll up and tie tightly with a
string crosswise. Roast or bake with oil and salt.
