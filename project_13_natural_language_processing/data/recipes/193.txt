ALMOND CRISP-TART

(Croccante)

  Sweet almonds, four and a half ounces.
  Granulated sugar, three and a half ounces.

Skin the almonds, divide the two parts and cut each part into small
pieces. Put these almonds so cut at the fire and dry them until they
take a yellowish color, but do not toast. Meanwhile put the sugar on the
fire in a saucepan and, when it is perfectly melted, pour the almonds
hot and already slightly browned. Now lower the fire and be careful not
to allow the compound to be overdone. The precise point is known when
the mixture acquires a cinnamon color. Then pour little by little in a
cold mold, previously greased with butter or oil. Press with a lemon
against the walls of the mold, making the mixture as thin as possible.
Remove from the mold when perfectly cooled and, if it is difficult to do
so, dip the mold in boiling water.

The almonds can also be dried in the sun and chopped fine, adding a
small piece of butter when they are in the sugar.
