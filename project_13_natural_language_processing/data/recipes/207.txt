MILK GNOCCHI

(Gnocchi di latte)

  One quart of milk.
  Sugar, nine ounces.
  Starch in powder, four ounces.
  Eight yolks of eggs.
  A taste of vanilla.

Mix everything together as you would do for a cream and put on the fire
in a saucepan, continually stirring with a ladle. When the mixture has
become hard keep it a few moments more on the fire and then pour it in a
plate to make it about half an inch thick and cut it into diamonds when
it is cold. Put these diamonds one over the other with symmetry in a
baking tin or in a fireproof glass plate, with some little pieces of
butter in between and brown them a little in the oven. Serve hot.
