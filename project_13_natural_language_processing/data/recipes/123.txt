The following is another way to prepare the codfish, slightly different
from the preceding. Cut the codfish as above, then put it as it is in
saucepan with some olive oil. Spread over it a hash of garlic and
parsley and season with a pinch of pepper, oil and little pieces of
butter. Cook on a good fire and turn it with care, because, not being
sprinkled with flour, it breaks easily. When it is cooked, squeeze a
lemon over and serve.
