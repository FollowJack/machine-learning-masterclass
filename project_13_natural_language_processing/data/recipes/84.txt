MUTTON CUTLETS AND FILET OF VEAL

(Braciuole di castrato e filetto di vitella)

Put in saucepan a slice of ham, some butter, a little bunch composed of
carrot, celery and stems of parsley and over this some whole cutlets of
mutton seasoned with salt and pepper. Make them brown on both sides, add
another piece of butter, if necessary, and add to the cutlets some
chicken giblets, sweetbreads and fresh or dry mushrooms (the latter
softened in water), all cut in pieces. When all this begins to brown,
pour some soup stock and let it simmer on a low fire. Sprinkle a little
flour and finally pour a wineglass (or half a tumbler) of white wine
leaving it boil a little more. When ready to serve remove the ham and
the greens, rub the gravy through a sieve and remove the superfluous
fat.
