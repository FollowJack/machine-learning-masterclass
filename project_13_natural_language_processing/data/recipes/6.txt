QUEEN'S SOUP

(Zuppa Regina)

This is made with the white meat of chicken, which is to be ground in a
meat grinder together with blanched almonds (5 or 6) for one quart of
chicken stock. To the meat and almond add some bread crumbs, first
soaked in milk or broth, in the proportion of about one fifth of the
quantity of the meat. All these ingredients are to be rubbed to a very
smooth paste and hot broth is to be added to them. If you wish the soup
to be richer and have a more milky consistency, use the yolk of an egg,
which should be beaten, and have a few tablespoonfuls of hot broth
stirred into it before adding to the soup. Do not let the soup boil
after the egg is added or it will curdle.

One slice of stale bread may be cut into cubes, fried in deep fat, and
the croutons put in the soup. Send it to the table with a dish of grated
cheese.
