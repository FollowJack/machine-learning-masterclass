STUFFED ITALIAN SQUASH

(Zucchini ripieni)

For a description of the =Zucchini= see No. 32.

To make the stuffed zucchini first cut them lengthwise in two halves and
remove the interior pulp, leaving space enough for the filling.

Take some lean veal (quantity in proportion to the squashes) cut it into
pieces and place it on the fire in a saucepan with a hash of onion,
parsley, celery, carrot, a little corned beef cut in little pieces, a
little oil, salt and pepper. Stir it often with a spoon and when the
meat is brown pour in a cup of water and then another after a while.
Then rub the gravy through a sieve and put it aside.

Chop the cooked meat fine and grind it in the grinder and make a hash of
it and one egg, a little grated cheese, a crumb of bread boiled in milk
or in soup stock and just a taste of nutmeg. Put this hash inside each
half squash and put them to brown in butter, completing the cooking with
the gravy set aside.
