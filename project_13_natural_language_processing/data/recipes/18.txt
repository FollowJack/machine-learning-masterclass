MACARONI A LA CORINNA

(Maccheroni alla Corinna)

Put on the fire a pot with two quarts of salted water to which add a
small piece of butter. When it begins to boil put in it 3/4 lb.
macaroni. Let it boil for five minutes, then drain them in a colander.
Put them again in new boiling water, prepared as above and let them cook
on a slow fire. Drain them again. Cover the bottom of a plate with
macaroni and cover this first layer with grated cheese and with some
vegetables in macédoine, that is, chopped fine and fried brown with
butter. Repeat the draining, moisten the macaroni with the water in
which they have previously cooked and keep on a low fire for ten minutes
more.

The =Macédoine= of vegetables can be made with a dozen Bruxelles sprouts
or one cabbage, half a dozen big asparagus cut in little pieces, a
carrot cut in thin slices, a dozen small onions, some turnips and half a
dozen mushrooms. The mushrooms and the asparagus can be omitted. Melt
some butter in a saucepan and when the turnips, the carrots and the
onions are half cooked, add the cabbage or sprouts. Put in some water
and some more butter, boil for ten minutes and then add the mushrooms
and the asparagus, adding salt and pepper, and a little sugar if this is
desired.
