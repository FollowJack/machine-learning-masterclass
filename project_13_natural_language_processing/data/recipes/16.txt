MACARONI WITH SAUCE

(Maccheroni al sugo)

The most appreciated kind of macaroni are those seasoned with tomato
sauce or with brown stock (see nos. 12 and 13). The macaroni are boiled
as above, then drained in a colander, returned to the saucepan and mixed
with the sauce and grated cheese. For those who like it some butter may
be added in the mixing.
