EGG-PLANTS IN THE OVEN

(Melanzane al forno)

Skin five or six egg-plants, cut them in round slices and salt them so
that they throw out the water that they contain. After a few hours dip
in flour and frying oil.

Take a fireproof vase or baking tin and place the slices in layers, with
grated cheese between each layer, abundantly seasoned with tomato sauce
(No. 12).

Beat one egg with a pinch of salt, a tablespoonful of tomato sauce, a
teaspoonful of grated cheese and two of crumbs of bread, and cover the
upper layer with this sauce. Put the vase in the oven and when the egg
is coagulated, serve hot.
