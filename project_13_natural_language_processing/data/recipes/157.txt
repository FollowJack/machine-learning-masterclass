VEAL SWEETBREADS

(Animelle di vitello)

Keep in fresh water for an hour. Then place them in a skimmer (ladle
with holes) and dip in boiling water or broth. After a brief boiling
remove and cool in cold water. Then remove the veins and gullet, taking
care not to tear them. The sweetbreads are prepared in various ways and
here we give some of the best known:

=Sweetbreads with butter.=--Boil in broth or water, clean and cut into
slices. Brown a piece of butter with salt and pepper. Then place the
sliced sweetbreads and brown them. Before serving squeeze on a little
lemon juice. The sweetbreads prepared in this way are served preferably
with rice or vegetables.

=Sweetbreads with white sauce.=--Boiled, cleaned and cut into slices,
they are placed in white sauce or =balsamella= (No. 54) adding a taste
of nutmeg, pepper, salt and the juice of half a lemon.

=Sweetbreads in fricassee.=--Boil, trim and cut into pieces. Then brown
in butter with a scallion chopped fine. Once browned, remove from the
gravy in which pour a tablespoonful of flour, moistened with broth. The
sauce that results is bound with egg-yolks and lemon juice.

=Sweetbreads fried.=--Boil and trim. Then cut in large slices, neither
too thick nor too thin. Dip in beaten egg and in bread crumbs ground.
Then fry in butter. Serve with vegetables.
