BROILED PIGEON

(Piccione in gratella)

Take a young, but fat pigeon, divide it in two parts lengthwise and
flatten it well with the hands. Then put it to brown in oil for four or
five minutes, just to harden the meat. Season when still hot with salt
and pepper, then arrange it as follows.

Melt in the fire, without boiling it, a piece of butter and mix the
liquid butter with one beaten egg. Dip the pigeon in the butter and egg
and keep it until it absorbs them. Then sprinkle with bread crumbs
ground fine. Cook on a grill on a low fire and serve with a sauce or a
side dish.
