BISCUIT

(Pezzo in gelo)

Make a cream with:

  Water, five ounces.
  Sugar, two ounces.
  The yolks of four eggs.
  A taste of vanilla.

Put it on the fire stirring continually and when it begins to stick to
the ladle remove from the fire and whip to a stiff froth. Then mix about
five ounces of ordinary whipped cream, put in a mold and pack in salt
and ice.

Keep in ice for about three hours.

This dose will be sufficient for seven or eight persons.
