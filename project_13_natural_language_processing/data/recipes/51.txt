STEWED HARE

(Stufato di lepre)

Take half of a good sized hare and, after cutting it in pieces, chop
fine one medium sized onion, one clove of garlic, a stalk of celery and
several leaves of rosemary. Put on the fire with some pieces of butter,
two tablespoonfuls of olive oil and four or five strips of bacon or salt
pork, when the whole has been browning for four or five minutes, put the
pieces of hare inside the saucepan and season them with salt, pepper and
spices. When it is browned, put a wineglass of white wine, some fresh
mushrooms, or dry mushrooms previously softened in water. Complete the
cooking with broth and tomato sauce and, if necessary, add another piece
of butter.
