ANCHOVY SAUCE

(Salsa d'Acciughe)

This recipe does not call for the filets of anchovies prepared for =hors
d'oeuvre=, but the less expensive and larger whole anchovies in salt to
be had in bulk or cans at large dealers. Wash them thoroughly in plenty
of water. Remove head, tail, backbone and skin and they are ready for
use.

Put five or six anchovies into a colander and dip quickly into boiling
water to loosen the skins, remove the salt, skin and bone them. Chop
them and put over the fire in a saucepan with a generous quantity of oil
and some pepper. Do not let them boil, but when they are hot add two
tablespoons of butter and three or four tablespoons of concentrated
tomato juice made by cooking down canned tomatoes and rubbing through a
sieve. When this sauce is used to season spaghetti, these must be boiled
in water that is only slightly salted and care must be taken not to let
them become too soft. The quantities above mentioned ought to be
sufficient for about one pound of spaghetti.
