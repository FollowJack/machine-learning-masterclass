BISCUIT

(Biscotto)

  Six eggs,
  Granulated sugar, nine ounces,
  Flour, four ounces,
  Potato meal, two ounces,
  Taste of lemon peel.

Stir for at least half an hour the yolks of the eggs with the sugar and
a tablespoonful only of the flour and meal, using a ladle. Beat the
whites of the eggs until they are quite firm, mix slowly with the first
mixture and when they are well incorporated pour over from a sieve the
flour and the potato meal, previously dried in the sun or on the fire.

Bake in a tin where the mixture comes about one inch and a half thick,
previously greasing the tin with cold butter and sprinkle with powdered
sugar mixed with flour.

In these cakes with beaten whites the following method can also be
followed: mix and stir first the yolks with the sugar, then put the
flour then, after a good kneading, beat the whites until they are firm,
pour two tablespoonfuls to soften the mixture, then the rest little by
little.
