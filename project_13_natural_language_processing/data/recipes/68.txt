I.

Put on the fire a hash of onion and butter and when it is well browned
cook in it a piece of lean veal seasoned with salt and pepper. When the
meat begins to brown put in a little sherry wine to complete the
cooking.

Pound the whole to soften it a little using the sauce remained and if
this is not enough add some broth and finally the yolk of an egg. See
that the whole is not softened too much.

Now take some wafers, not too thin and cut them in squares similar to
those used by druggists. Beat one egg and the white from the other egg,
then take a wafer, dip it in the egg and place it on a layer of bread
crumbs ground fine. On the wafer put a little ball of the compound
above, then dip another wafer in the egg, make it touch the bread crumbs
only from the part that remains outside, and with this cover the
compound attaching it to the lower wafer. Sprinkle again with bread
crumbs if necessary and put the piece aside repeating the operation
until all the meat is disposed of. Cook in oil or fat and serve with
lemon.

With half a pound of meat about twenty filled wafers should be obtained.
