PURÉE OF CELERY

(Macco di sedani)

Take some big roots of celery, prepare as usual and wash in running
water. Boil in salted water, crush and rub through a sieve. Put in a
saucepan this purée, with a piece of butter, salt, flour and a little
cream or milk. The milk may be substituted with good soup stock or brown
stock. Just before serving add a little powdered sugar.
