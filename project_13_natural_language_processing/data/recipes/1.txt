BROTH OR SOUP STOCK

(Brodo)

To obtain good broth the meat must be put in cold water, and then
allowed to boil slowly. Add to the meat some pieces of bones and "soup
greens" as, for instance, celery, carrots and parsley. To give a brown
color to the broth, some sugar, first browned at the fire, then diluted
in cold water, may be added.

While it is not considered that the broth has much nutritive power, it
is excellent to promote the digestion. Nearly all the Italian soups are
made on a basis of broth.

A good recipe for substantial broth to be used for invalids is the
following: Cut some beef in thin slices and place them in a large
saucepan; add some salt. Pour cold water upon them, so that they are
entirely covered. Cover the saucepan so that it is hermetically closed
and place on the cover a receptacle containing water, which must be
constantly renewed. Keep on a low fire for six hours, then on a strong
fire for ten minutes. Strain the liquid in cheese cloth.

The soup stock, besides being used for soups, is a necessary ingredient
in hundreds of Italian dishes.
