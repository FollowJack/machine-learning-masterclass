FISH WITH BREAD CRUMBS

(Pesce col pane grattato)

This, which can also be served as a side-dish, is made especially when
you have boiled fish of good quality left over.

Cut it into little pieces, remove carefully all the bones, then put it
in the =balsamella= (No. 54) and season with enough salt, grated cheese
and some mushrooms chopped fine. If dried mushrooms soften in water
first. Then take a fireproof plate, grease it evenly with butter and
dust with bread crumbs ground fine; pour into it the fish prepared as
above and cover with a thin layer of bread crumbs. Finally put over a
piece of butter, brown in the oven and serve hot.
