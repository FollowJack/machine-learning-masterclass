VEGETABLE CHOWDER

(Minestrone alla Milanese)

Cut off the rind of 1/2 lb. salt pork and put it into two quarts of
water to boil. Cut off a small slice of the pork and beat it to a paste
with two or three sprigs of parsley, a little celery and one kernel of
garlic. Add this paste to the pork and water. Slice two carrots, cut the
rib out of the leaves of 1/4 medium sized cabbage. Add the carrots,
cabbage leaves, other vegetables, seasoning and butter to the soup, and
let it boil slowly for 2-1/2 hours. The last 1/2 hour add one small
handful of rice for each person.

When the pork is very soft, remove and slice in little ribbons and put
it back.

The minestrone is equally good eaten cold.
