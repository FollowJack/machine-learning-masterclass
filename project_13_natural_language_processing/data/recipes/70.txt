RICE PANCAKE

(Frittelle di riso)

Cook thoroughly 1/4 lb. of rice in about a pint of water giving it taste
with a little piece of sugar and a taste of lemon peel. Leave it cool
and then add three yolks of eggs and a little flour. Mix well and let
the whole rest for several hours. When you are going to fry beat the
white of an egg to a froth, add it to the rice and throw into the frying
pan one tablespoonful at a time.

Serve hot sprinkled with confectionery sugar.
