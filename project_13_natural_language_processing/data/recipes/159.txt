STUFFED ONIONS

(Cipolle ripiene)

Boil six large onions for an hour. Then drain and skin. Remove the heart
with the point of a knife. In the place of the heart place the stuffing
made with 1/4 lb. ham or tongue, chopped and mixed with bread crumbs
ground, two tablespoonfuls of milk, two pinches of salt and one of
pepper. When the onions are prepared and stuffed place them in a
saucepan whose bottom has been greased with butter, sprinkle with bread
crumbs ground and place in the oven, not too hot. At the time of serving
add some white sauce or =balsamella= (No 54). Stuffed onions are served
as vegetables, or side-dish with roast-beef or boiled-beef.
