CELERY AU JUS

(Sedano al sugo)

Select nine or ten heads, neither too hard nor too soft, and cut them
about four inches from the root. Remove the green and hard branches and
trim the root, cutting the latter to a point. Scald the celery, after
washing well, in salted boiling water. Ten minutes will be sufficient.
Dip in cold water, open well the leaves and wash again carefully. Drain
and make bunches of two or three heads each that you will put in a
saucepan with a pint of broth or water and half a cup of good fat, onion
and carrot chopped, salt and pepper. Cover and let it simmer for about
two hour. Then remove the celery, drain and serve.
