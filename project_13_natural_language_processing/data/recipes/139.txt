STUFFED CHICKEN

(Pollo ripieno)

For a middle-sized fowl use the following ingredients: two sausages, the
liver and giblets of the fowl, eight or ten chestnuts well roasted, some
pieces of mushrooms, a taste of nutmeg, one egg. If, instead of a fowl,
it is a turkey, double the dose.

Begin by giving the sausages and the giblets half a cooking, moistening
them with a little broth if necessary. Season with a little salt and
pepper on account of the sausages that already contain them. Remove them
and in the gravy that remains put a crumb of bread, in order to obtain
with a little broth two tablespoonfuls of thick pap. Skin the sausages,
chop the chicken giblets and the giblets and grind everything together
with the chestnuts, the egg and the pap; this is the stuffing with which
the fowl is to be filled, to be baked afterward. It is more tasty cold
than hot, and it can also be cut better.
