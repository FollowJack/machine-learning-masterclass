CUTLETS OF CHOPPED MEAT

(Scaloppine di carne battuta)

Take some good lean beef, clean it well, removing all little skins and
tendons, then first chop and after grind the meat fine in the grinder.
Season with salt, pepper and a pinch of grated cheese. Mix well and give
the meat the form of a ball then with bread crumbs over and beneath
flatten it with the rolling pin on the bread board making a sheet of
meat as thick as a silver dollar. Cut it in square pieces, as large as
the palm of the hand and cook in a saucepan with butter. When these
cutlets are browned, pour over some tomato sauce and serve.

If you prefer, use your hands instead of the rolling pin and then you
can give them the shapes you like.

If you have some left over meat this can perfectly well be mixed with
the raw meat and chopped and ground together.
