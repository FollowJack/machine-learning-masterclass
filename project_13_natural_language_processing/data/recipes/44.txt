CHICKEN WITH EGG SAUCE

(Pollo in salsa d'uova)

Break into pieces a young chicken and put it in the saucepan with a
piece of butter. Season with salt and pepper. When it is half browned
sprinkle with a pinch of flour to give it color, then complete the
cooking with broth. Remove it from the same and put it on a plate. Beat
the yolk of one egg with the piece of half a lemon and pour it on the
sauce of the chicken, allowing it to simmer for some minutes. Then pour
on the chicken and serve hot.
