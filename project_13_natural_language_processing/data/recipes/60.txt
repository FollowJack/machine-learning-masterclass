CURLED OMELET

(Frittata in riccioli)

Boil a bunch of spinach and rub it through a sieve. Beat two eggs,
season with salt and pepper and mix with them enough spinach to make the
eggs appear green. Put the frying pan on the fire with only enough oil
to grease it and when very hot put in a portion of the eggs, moving the
frying pan so as to make a very thin omelet. When well cooked, remove it
from the frying pan and repeat the operation once or twice in order to
have two or three very thin omelets. Put these one over the other and
cut them in small strips that are to be browned in butter adding a
little grated cheese. These strips of omelet, resembling noodles, form a
tasty and attractive dressing for a fricandeau (veal stew) or a similar
dish.
