CHICKEN WITH HAM

(Pollo in porchetta)

Fill a chicken with thin strips of ham, about half an inch wide. Add
three cloves (or sections) of garlic, two little bunches of fennel and a
few grains of pepper. Season outside with salt and pepper and cook in a
saucepan with butter, or preferably bake in the oven. Sausages cut
lengthwise and previously skinned can be substituted for the ham.
