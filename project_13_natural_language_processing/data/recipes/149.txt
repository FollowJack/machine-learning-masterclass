STEAK IN THE SAUCEPAN

(Bistecca nel tegame)

If you have a steak that does not appear to be too tender, put it in a
saucepan with a little piece of butter and some good olive oil, with a
taste of garlic and bay-leaf or rosemary. Add, if necessary, a little
broth or water or tomato sauce and serve with potatoes cooked in the
gravy that can be made more abundant with more broth, butter and tomato
sauce.
