BREAST OF VEAL STEWED

(Stufatino di petto di vitella)

Break a piece of breast of veal leaving all its bones.

Make a hash with garlic, parsley, celery and carrot; add oil, pepper and
salt and put on the fire with the meat. Turn it over often, and when it
begins to brown, sprinkle over a pinch of flour and a little tomato
sauce or tomato paste diluted in water. Complete the cooking with broth
or water. Finally add a piece of butter and pieces of celery cut in big
pieces which must have been before half cooked in water and browned in
butter. Care must be taken to keep the saucepan always covered, in this
as in other stews.
