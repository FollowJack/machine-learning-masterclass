ASPARAGUS

(Sparagi)

Asparagus can be prepared in many different ways, but the simplest and
best is that of boiling them and serving them seasoned with olive oil
and vinegar or lemon juice. However there are other ways as, for
instance, the following: Put them whole to brown a little with the green
part in butter and, after seasoning them with salt, pepper and a pinch
of grated cheese, pour over the melted butter when it is browned. Or
else divide the white from the green part and place them as follows in a
fireproof plate: Dust the bottom with grated cheese and dispose over the
points of the asparagus one near the other; season with salt, pepper,
grated cheese and little pieces of butter. Make another layer of
asparagus and, seasoning in the same way, continue until you have them.
Be moderate in the seasoning. Cross the layers of asparagus like a
trestle, put on the oven and keep until the seasoning, is melted. Serve
hot.

If you have some brown stock, parboil them first and complete the
cooking with brown stock, adding a little bust and dusting moderately
with grated cheese.
