ARTICHOKES STUFFED WITH MEAT

(Carciofi ripieni di carne)

For six artichokes, make the following stuffing:

  1/4 lb. lean veal.
  Two slices of ham, more fat than lean.
  The interior part of the artichokes.
  One fourth of onion (small).
  Some leaves of parsley.
  One pinch of softened dried mushrooms.
  One small crumb of bread rolled and sifted.
  One pinch of grated cheese.

When the artichokes have been browned with oil alone, pour a little
water and cover with a moistened cloth kept in place by the cover. The
steam that surrounds the artichokes cooks them better.
