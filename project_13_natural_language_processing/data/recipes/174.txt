TROUT ALPINE

(Trota all'alpigiana)

These are many ways to prepare this delicious fish, found in abundance
in the many streams of clear water that run from the Alps and the
Apennine mountains. Often the trout is cooked in wine, but, of course,
this part many be changed.

For the =trota all'alpigiana=, so called because it is the favorite dish
of Piedmont, the trout must be cleaned, scaled, washed, wiped then
salted and left under the action of the salt for about an hour.

Pour in a fish-kettle one quart of white wine to which will be added
three medium sized onions a few cloves, two sections of garlic and a
little bunch made of thyme, bay-leaf, basil or mint; finally a piece of
butter as large as an egg, dipped in flour. Then put the trout in the
fish-kettle and place on a strong fire. When the liquid has boiled the
trout is cooked. Remove the onions and the bunch of greens and serve the
trout with its gravy and some parsley.
