LEMON ICE

(Gelato di limone)

  Granulated sugar, 3/4 lb.
  Water, a pint.
  Lemons, three (good sized).

Boil the sugar in the water, with some little pieces of lemon peel, for
about ten minutes, in an uncovered kettle. When this syrup is cold,
squeeze the lemons one at the time, tasting the mixture to regulate the
degree of acidity. Then strain and put in the freezer packed with salt
and ice.
