TENDERLOIN WITH SPICES

(Filetto alla piemontese)

Clean and trim the meat, removing all the little skins. Then sprinkle
with nutmeg, cinnamon, salt, and pepper, and place in an earthen vase
covered, together with a bunch of aromatic herbs, sage, parsley,
rosemary, onion, carrot and celery, all chopped fine. After a few hours
melt and brown a piece of butter with the aromatic herbs, then remove
the latter and place the tenderloin, leaving it to simmer for half an
hour, pricking it often with a large fork or a larding pin, to add its
juice to the gravy. Serve hot.
