VEAL KIDNEY SLICED

(Rognone di vitello affettato)

Cut in thin slices one or two veal kidneys, removing the granulous part
that is to be found in the middle, and put the slices in a saucepan with
a piece of butter, a bunch of parsley chopped very fine together with a
clove of garlic. Add a cup of hot broth; salt moderately and let it cook
without boiling, until the sauce is reduced to about one third.

One tablespoonful of vinegar adds a pleasant taste to this dish.
