WAFER BISCUITS

(Cialdoni)

Put in a kettle:

  Flour, three ounces.
  Brown sugar, one ounce.
  Lard virgin, half an ounce.
  Cold water, seven tablespoonfuls.

First dilute the flour and the sugar in the water, then add the lard.

Put on the fire the iron for waffles or better an appropriated iron for
flattened wafers. When it is quite hot open it and place each time half
a tablespoonful of the paste. Close the iron and press well. Pass over
the fire on both sides, trim all around with a knife and open the iron
when you see that the wafer is browned. Then detach it from one side of
the iron and hot as it is roll it on the iron itself or on a napkin
using a little stick. This operation must be made with great rapidity
because if the wafer gets cold, it cannot be rolled.

Should the wafers remain attached to the iron, grease it from time to
time, and if they are not firm enough, add a little flour.

These wafer-biscuits are generally served with whipped cream.
