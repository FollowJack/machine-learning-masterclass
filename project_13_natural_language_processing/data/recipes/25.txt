RISOTTO WITH LOBSTER

(Risotto coi gamberi)

For this risotto either lobster or crab meat can be used: the former is,
however, considered more tasty. The lobster or crab meat ought to be
about half the weight of the rice employed. A little more than a pound
of rice and half this weight of crab meat ought to be enough for six
persons.

Chop fine a sprig of parsley, a stalk of celery, one carrot, half an
onion a clove of garlic and brown the whole in good olive oil. When
browned, add the crab meat and season with salt and pepper. During the
cooking process stir and turn over the crabs, and when they have become
red, pour over as much hot water as is necessary to cook the rice.

After the water boils for a while, remove the lobster (or crab, or
craw-fish) leaving the saucepan on the fire. Put half of the crabs
aside, and grind the rest. Rub the ground meat through the sieve and put
it back on the fire. In another saucepan melt some butter and put into
it little by little the rice that has been washed and dried. Stir and
add the broth from the first saucepan. When the rice is almost cooked
add the craw-fish that you have put aside, or rather its meat extracted
from the shells, take from the fire and pour over it the fish mixture,
adding some grated cheese.
