VEAL LIVER IN GRAVY

(Fegato di vitella al sugo)

Chop fine a scallion or an onion, make it brown in oil and butter, and
when it has taken a dark red color, throw in the liver cut in thin
slices. When half cooked season with salt, pepper and a pinch of
chopped parsley. Make it simmer on a low fire so that the gravy remains,
and serve in its gravy, squeezing over some lemon juice when sent to the
table.

In this and in similar cases, when using scallions or onions, some
advise putting these in a cloth after being chopped and dip them in cold
water squeezing them dry after.
