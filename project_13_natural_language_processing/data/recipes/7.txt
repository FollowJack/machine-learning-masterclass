BEAN SOUP

(Zuppa di fagiuoli)

One cup of dried beans, kidney, navy or lima is to be soaked over night.
Then boil until tender. It is preferable to put the beans to cook in
cold water with a pinch of soda. When they come to boil, pour off this
water and add fresh.

Chop fine 1/4 onion, one clove of garlic, one sprig of parsley and one
piece of celery and put them to fry in 1/4 cup of oil with salt and a
generous amount of pepper. When the vegetables are a delicate brown add
to them two cups of the broth from the beans and 1 cup of tomatoes
(canned or fresh). Let all come to a boil and pour the mixture into the
kettle of beans from which some of the water has been drained, if they
are very liquid. This soup may be served as it is or rubbed through a
sieve before serving. Croutons or triangles of dry toast make an
excellent addition.

The bean soup is made without meat or chicken broth, and it belongs
consequently to that class of soup called by the Italians "=Minestra di
Magro=" or "lean soup," to be served preferably on Friday and other days
in which the Roman Catholic Church prohibits the use of meats.
