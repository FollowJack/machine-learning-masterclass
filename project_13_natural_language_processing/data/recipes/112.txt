STUFFED CABBAGE

(Cavolo ripieno)

Take a big cabbage, remove the hard outside leaves, cut the stem off
even with the leaves and give it half cooking in salt water. Put it
upside down to drain, then open the leaves one by one until the heart is
exposed and on this put the stuffing. Bring up all the leaves, close
them and tie with thread crosswise.

The stuffing can be made with milk veal stewed alone, or with sweetbread
or chicken liver, all chopped fine. To make it more delicate, add some
=balsamella= (No 54) a pinch of grated cheese, one yolk of egg and a
taste of nutmeg. Complete the cooking of the cabbage in the sauce of
this stew, adding a little butter, on a low fire or in the oven kept
low.

Instead of filling the whole cabbage, the larger leaves may be filled
one by one, rolling and tying them.
