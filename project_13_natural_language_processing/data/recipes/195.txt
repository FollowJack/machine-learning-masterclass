QUINCE CAKE

(Cotognata)

The ingredients are about six pounds of quinces and four pounds of
granulated sugar.

Put on the fire the apples covered with water, and when they begin to
crack remove them, skin and scrape to put together all the pulp. Rub the
latter through a sieve. Put back the pulp on the fire with the sugar and
stir continually in order that it may not attack to the bottom of the
kettle. It will be enough to boil for seven or eight minutes and remove
when it begins to form pieces when lifted with the ladle.

Now in order to prepare the quince-cake spread it on a board to the
thickness of about a silver dollar and dry it in the sun covered with
cheese cloth to keep away the flies. When it is dry cut it in the form
of chocolate tablets and remove each piece from the board passing the
blade of a knife underneath.

If it is wished to make it crisp, melt about three and a half pounds of
granulated sugar with two tablespoonfuls of water and when the sugar has
boiled enough to "make the thread" smear every one of the little quince
cakes with it. If the sugar becomes too hard during the operation put it
back on the fire with a little water and make it boil again. When the
sugar is dry on one side and on the edge, smear the other side.
