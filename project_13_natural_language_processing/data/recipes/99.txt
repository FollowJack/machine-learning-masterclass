DRIED MUSHROOMS

(Funghi secchi)

Mushrooms are an excellent condiment of various dishes and for this
reason it is well to have some always at hand. Since, however, it is
not always possible to have them fresh, the following recipe to prepare
dried mushrooms will be found useful.

First of all wait until there is a sunny day. Choose young mushrooms
middle sized or big, but not too soft. Scrape the stem, clean them well
in order to remove the earth and, without washing cut them in big
pieces. This because when dried they diminish considerably in size. Keep
these pieces exposed in the sun for two or three days, then thread them
on a string (practising a hole in them) and keep in a well ventilated
room or in the sun until they become quite dry. Then put them away well
closed in a paper bag, but don't fail to look at them from time to time
to see if it is necessary to expose them some more to sun and
ventilation.

To use them soften in warm water, but keep them in as little as
possible, so that they do not lose their delicate flavor. The best time
to dry the mushrooms is June or July.
