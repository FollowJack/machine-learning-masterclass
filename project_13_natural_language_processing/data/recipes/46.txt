WILD DUCK

(Anitra selvatica)

Clean the duck, putting aside the giblets, and cut off the head and
legs. Chop fine a thick slice of ham with both lean and fat together,
with a moderate amount of celery, parsley, carrot and half medium sized
onion. Put the chopped ham and vegetables in a saucepan and lay the duck
on the whole, seasoning with salt and pepper. Brown on all sides and add
water to complete the cooking.

Cabbage or lentils, cooked in water and afterward allowed to complete
the cooking in the sauce obtained from the duck, form a good addition.

To remove the "gamey" taste from the wild duck, either wash it in
vinegar before cooking or scald it in boiling water.
