STEW MILANAISE

(Stufato alla milanese)

Beat and flatten a good piece of meat and lard with bacon or ham cut in
small pieces. Season with salt, pepper and a taste of cinnamon. Sprinkle
flour over the meat.

Place in a saucepan a little fat of beef chopped with a middle sized
onion and brown with a piece of butter. When the onion is browned,
remove it and place the meat over the melted butter. Brown with melted
butter. Then fill the saucepan with half water, half red wine, but only
when the meat is browned from all sides. Cover the saucepan the best you
can, with cover and greased paper and let it simmer for five or six
hours on a very low fire.

After removing the stew, let it cool, rub the gravy through a sieve, put
again on the fire and serve hot.
