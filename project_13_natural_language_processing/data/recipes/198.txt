FARINA CAKES

(Pasticcini di semolino)

  Farina, six and a half ounces.
  Sugar, three and a half ounces.
  Pine-seeds, two ounces.
  Butter, a small piece.
  Milk, one quart.
  Four eggs.
  A pinch of salt.
  Taste of lemon peel.

Cook the farina in the milk and when it begins to thicken pour the
pine-seeds, previously chopped fine and pounded with the sugar, then the
butter and the rest, less the eggs which must be put in last when the
mixture has completely cooled. Then place the whole well mixed in little
molds, greased evenly with butter and sprinkled with bread crumbs ground
fine, and bake.
