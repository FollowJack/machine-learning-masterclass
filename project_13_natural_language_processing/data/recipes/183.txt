CRISP BISCUITS

(Biscotti croccanti)

  One pound of flour.
  Half a pound granulated sugar.
  1/4 lb. sweet almonds, whole and shelled, mixed to a few pine-seeds.
  A piece of butter, one and a half ounce.
  A pinch of anise-seeds.
  Five eggs.
  A pinch of salt.

Leave back the almonds and pine-seeds to add them afterward, and mix
everything with four eggs, so as to use the fifth if it is necessary to
make a soft dough. Divide into four cakes half an inch thick and as
large as a hand, place them in a receptacle greased with butter and
sprinkled with flour. Glaze the cakes with yolk of eggs. Bake in the
oven, but only as much as will still permit cutting the cakes into
slices, which you will do the day after, as the crust will then be
softened. Put the slices back in the oven, so that they will be toasted
on both sides and you will have the crisp biscuits.
