VEAL WITH TUNNY

(Vitello tonnato)

Take two pounds of meat without bones, remove the fat and tendons, then
lard it with two anchovies. These must be washed and boned and cut
lengthwise, after opening them, making in all eight pieces. Tie the
piece of meat not very tight and boil it for an hour and a half in
enough water to cover it completely. Previously put into the water one
quarter of an onion larded with clover, one leaf of laurel, celery,
carrot and parsley. Salt the water generously and don't put the veal in
until it is boiling. When the veal is cooked, untie, dry it and keep it
for two or three days in the following sauce in quantity sufficient to
cover it.

Grind 1/4 pound tunny fish preserved in olive oil and two anchovies,
crush them well with the blade of a knife and rub through a sieve adding
good olive oil in abundance little by little, and squeeze in one whole
lemon, so that the sauce should remain liquid. Finally mix in some
capers soaked in vinegar.

Serve the veal cold, in thin slices, with the sauce.

The stock of the veal can be rubbed through a sieve and used for
risotto.
