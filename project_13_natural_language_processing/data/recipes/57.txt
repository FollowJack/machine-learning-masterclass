CAPER SAUCE

(Salsa con capperi)

This sauce is especially adapted for boiled fish and the quantities are
for a little more than one pound of fish. The ingredients are two ounces
of butter, two ounces of capers soaked in vinegar one teaspoonful of
flour, salt, pepper and vinegar.

Boil the fish and, when it is left warm in its broth, prepare the sauce.
Put on the fire the flour with half of the butter, mix it and when it
begins to take color, add the remaining butter.

Let boil a little and then pour one half cup of the broth of the fish:
season generously with salt and pepper and take the saucepan from the
fire. Then throw in it the capers, half whole, half chopped, and some
drops of vinegar, but taste it to dose the sauce so that it is pleasant
to the taste and as thick as liquid cream.

It is well to observe here that these sauces in which butter is used
together with acids, such as vinegar, are not for weak stomachs and
should be partaken of sparingly.
