STRING BEANS IN MOLD

(Sformato di fagiolini)

Take one pound of string beans, seeing that they are quite tender. Cut
off the ends and remove the strings. Throw them into boiling water with
a pinch of salt and when they are half cooked take them away and put
them in cold water. If you have brown stock complete the cooking with
this and with butter, otherwise brown a piece of onion, some parsley, a
piece of celery and olive oil. When the onion is browned put in the
string beans and complete the cooking with a little water if necessary.

Prepare a =Balsamella= sauce (No. 54) with a small piece of butter,
half a teaspoonful of flour and half a cup of milk. With this, a
tablespoonful of grated cheese and four beaten eggs bind the string
beans when they are cold, mix and put in a mold, evenly greased with
butter and the bottom covered with paper. Cook in a double boiler and
serve hot.
