STUFFED CUTLET

(Braciuoline ripiene)

Slice from a piece of veal (about one pound) seven or eight cutlets and
beat them well with a knife blade to flatten them. Then chop some tender
veal meat and one or two slices of ham and add a small quantity of
marrow bone (of veal) and grated cheese. The marrow and the grated
cheese must be reduced to a paste with the blade of a knife. One egg is
then added to tie up the hash and a pinch of pepper, but no salt on
account of the ham and the cheese that already contain it. Spread the
cutlets and put the hash in the middle, then roll them up and tie them
with strong thread.

Now prepare a small hash with a little onion, a piece of celery a piece
of carrot and a small quantity of corned beef and put it in the fire in
a saucepan with a small piece of butter, at the same time that you put
the cutlets. Season with salt and pepper and when they begin to brown
pour some tomato sauce and complete the cooking with water. Before
serving, remove the thread with which the cutlets have been tied.
