RASPBERRY SYRUP

(Sciroppo di lampone)

This is prepared like the other explained above but, since this fruit
contains less gluten than the gooseberry the period of fermentation will
be briefer. The large quantity of sugar used in these syrups is
necessary for their conservation and the citric acid is used to correct
the excessive sweetness.
