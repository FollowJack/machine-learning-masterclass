SCRAMBLED EGGS

(Uova strapazzate)

Break the eggs in a plate, assuring first that they are all fresh.

Melt in a saucepan a piece of butter about as big as an egg. When it is
melted pour the egg and scramble them with a fork on a low fire.

When the eggs are cooked season moderately with salt and butter. Just
when you take them away from the fire and before serving add a
tablespoonful of milk or liquid cream. Serve hot with a little grated
cheese.

The scrambled eggs can be served with points of asparagus, truffles,
mushrooms, etc. which are prepared just as if they were to go in an
omelet.
