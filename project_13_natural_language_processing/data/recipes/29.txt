STEAMED ARTICHOKES

(Carciofi a vapore)

Artichokes have been only recently imported to the United States,
principally by Italian farmers, and they are just beginning to find
their way into the American kitchen. The artichokes may be eaten raw or
cooked. It is a healthy and palatable vegetable, easily digested when
cooked. It is nutritious and adapted for convalescents. It may be
prepared in a thousand ways, and here follow some of the simplest and
most tasteful.

To prepare the steamed artichokes they must first be cleaned and the
stalk cut to less than half an inch. Put them in a saucepan, standing on
their bottoms, one near the other, in half an inch or more of water. In
an opening made in the middle put salt and pepper, and pour inside as
much good olive oil as they may contain. Cover well the saucepan and put
it on the fire. The artichokes, that are already seasoned, will be
cooked by the steam.
