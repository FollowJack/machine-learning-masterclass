VEAL WITH GRAVY

(Vitella in guazzetto)

First take about one pound of veal and tie it well. Then cover the
bottom of the saucepan with some thin slices of corned beef and a piece
of butter. Over this place half a lemon cut in four thin slices from
which the skin and the seeds must be removed. Over all this put the veal
which must be well browned on all sides, but care must be taken not to
burn it on account of the small quantity of liquid. Afterward, remove
the superfluous fat and pour over a cup of hot milk, that has boiled.
Cover the saucepan and complete the cooking. Before serving rub the
gravy through a sieve.
