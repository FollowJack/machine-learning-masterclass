LEMON PUDDING

(Budino di limone)

  One big lemon.
  Sugar, six ounces.
  Sweet almonds with 3 bitter ones, six ounces.
  Six eggs.

Cook the lemon in water, for which two hours will be enough. Remove dry
and rub through a sieve. Before rubbing, however, taste it, because if
it has a bitter taste it must be kept in cold water until it has lost
that unpleasant taste. Add the sugar, the almonds skinned and ground
very fine and the six yolks of the eggs. Beat the whites of the eggs and
add them to the mixture that will then be put in a mold and baked like
all other puddings.
