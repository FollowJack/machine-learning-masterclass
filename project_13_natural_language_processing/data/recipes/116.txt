STEWED FISH CUTLETS

(Pesce a taglio in umido)

The fish that can be used for this dish are the tunny, the umber or
grayling, the sword fish and any piece of fish of large size and good
savor. A pound may be sufficient for four or five persons.

Remove the scales, clean and dry well, dip in flour and put to brown in
a little oil. Remove dry, throw away the oil that remains and clean the
saucepan. Make a hash, chopped very fine, with half a middle sized
onion, a piece of white celery and a good pinch of parsley. Put this to
brown on the fire with sufficient oil and season with salt, pepper and
one whole clove. When it is browned put abundant tomato sauce (No 12) or
tomato paste diluted in broth or water. Let it simmer for a while, then
place the fish to complete the cooking, turning it over frequently. The
fish must be served with this thick gravy that ought to be abundant.
