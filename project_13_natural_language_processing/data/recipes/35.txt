CHICKEN ALLA CACCIATORA

(Pollo alla cacciatora)

Chop one large onion and keep it for more than half an hour in cold
water, then dry it and brown it aside. Cut up a chicken, sprinkle the
pieces with flour, salt and pepper and saut√©, in the fat which remains
in the frying pan. When the chicken is brown add one pint fresh or
canned tomatoes and half a dozen sweet green peppers and put back the
onion. When the gravy is thick enough add hot water to prevent the
burning of the vegetables. Cover the pan tightly and simmer until the
chicken is very tender. This is an excellent way to cook tough chickens.
Fowls which have been boiled may be cooked in this way, but of course
young and tender chickens will have the finer flavor.
