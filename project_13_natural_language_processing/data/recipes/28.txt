FRIED ARTICHOKE

(Carciofi fritti)

Take two artichokes, cut out the hard part of the leaves and of the
stalk, cut them in two. Then cut these halves into section or slices so
as to have eight or ten for each artichoke, according to size. As you
cut them, throw them into cold water and when they are well washed, dry
them, but not thoroughly, putting them at once into the flour so that
the latter remains attached to it. Beat the white of an egg, but not to
a froth, then mix the yolk with the white and salt the whole. Shake out
the artichokes to take away the superfluous flour and then put them in
the egg, leaving them for a while so that the egg may be attached to
them.

Throw the pieces one by one into the pan where there is boiling fat,
butter or olive oil, and when they are well browned, take them away and
serve with lemon. If it is desired that the artichokes remain white, it
is better to fry them in oil and to squeeze half lemon into the water
where the artichokes are put to soften.
