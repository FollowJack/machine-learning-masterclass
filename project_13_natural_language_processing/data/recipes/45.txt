CHICKEN BREASTS SAUTÉS

(Petti di pollo alla sauté)

Cut the breast of a fowl in very thin slices, give them the best
possible shape and make a whole piece from the little pieces that will
remain, cleaning well the breast-bone, crushing and mixing these. Season
with salt and pepper and dip the slices in beaten eggs, leaving them for
a few hours. Sprinkle with bread crumbs ground fine and sauté in butter.
Serve with lemon.

If you want this dish more elaborate prepare a sauce in the following
way: Put some good olive oil in a frying pan, just enough to cover the
bottom, and cover the oil with a layer of dry mushrooms. Sprinkle over
a small quantity of grated cheese and some bread crumbs. Repeat the same
operation three or four times, according to the quantity, and finally
season with olive oil, salt and pepper and small pieces of butter. Put
the pan over the fire and when it has begun to boil pour a small cup of
brown stock or broth and a little lemon juice. Remove the same from the
fire and pour it on the chicken breast that have been browned as
described above.
