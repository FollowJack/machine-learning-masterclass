BALSAMELLA SAUCE

(Salsa balsamella)

This sauce resembles the famous French BÃ©chamel Sauce, but it is simpler
in its composition.

Put in a saucepan one tablespoonful of flour and a piece of butter as
big as an egg. Stir the flour and the butter together while keeping them
over the fire. When the flour begins to be browned, pour over a pint of
milk, continually stirring with a wooden spoon until you see the liquid
condensed like a cream. This is the =Balsamella=. If it is too thick add
some milk, if too liquid put back on the fire with another piece of
butter dipped in flour.

A good =Balsamella= and some well prepared brown stock are the base and
the principal secret of many savory dishes.
