(Risotto con piselli)

Wash and dry 1-1/2 lb. rice; chop fine one medium sized onion and put it
on the fire with a small quantity of butter.

When the onion is well browned, add the rice little by little, stirring
with a wooden spoon. Add some boiling water one cup at a time. Drain the
peas previously prepared (fresh or canned peas may be used) and add them
toward the end of the cooking. When the whole is almost cooked, add some
salt and take it away from the water almost dry. Add some butter, stir
and serve hot.
