title: Hands on Kubernetes management with Python using Kube
speaker: david-charles
---
Kubernetes (K8s) is the Google Borg inspired control plane for Docker containers that everyone is talking about.  It has a great API but needs a load of HTTP client code and JSON processing to use it from Python.  This workshop will quickly get you up to speed on using Kube, a Python wrapper around the K8s API.  You'll learn how to connect to the API server for your K8s cluster; and how to view, create, update and delete resources within it.  You'll also learn about Kube's support for the 'Watch' API which enables your code to respond to resource updates in you K8s cluster.
