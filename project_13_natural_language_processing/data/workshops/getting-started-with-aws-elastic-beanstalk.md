Learn how to get started with AWS Elastic Beanstalk, so you can outsource your infrastructure and focus on writing the code unique to you

I think PaaS-en are awesome, I think more people should be using PaaS-en rather than reinventing the wheel poorly, and I think AWS Elastic Beanstalk is one of the best PaaS-en out there.

In this workshop I'll guide you through creating an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application (using their Docker interface) and deploying a basic webapp to it; I'll walk you through various features Elastic Beanstalk provides to make operating, scaling, reviewing and debugging your app easier; finally I'll talk you through other AWS services and how you can use those with EB to make things even more awesome.

You will need:

* A laptop (or similar)
* Basic familiarity with Git and GitHub
* A GitHub account
* [An AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

Things that would be useful, but are absolutely not required:

* Experience with Docker
* Experience with CircleCI/TravisCI or similar
* Experience with AWS

## Who am I?

I'm Kristian Glass and I've been dealing with software in production for the last 15 years. 

I'm the CTO at LaterPay, where AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes up a large chunk of our tech stack, and prior to that I ran Moorhen Solutions Ltd. - a one-person consultancy where I helped tech teams scale their systems and infrastructure.

I believe that too many people spend time handrolling their own crude PaaS-like systems and should just use someone else's - to that end I want you to let me show you the joys of AWS's Elastic Beanstalk, one of my favourite PaaS-en.
