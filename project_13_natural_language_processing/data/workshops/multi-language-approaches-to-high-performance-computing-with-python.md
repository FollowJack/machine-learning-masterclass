speaker: russel-winder

High performance computing with Python is usually taken to mean using Cython, Numba, NumPy, etc. Using C extensions is usually seen as bad move, and this has affected the idea of using C++ extensions. But why not use a really good high performance language such as D, or better still Chapel. In this workshop we will try things out so that attenders can make their own assessment of whether a multi-language approach works for them.
