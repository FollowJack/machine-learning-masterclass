title: Introduction to Graphene and Relay
speaker: marc-tamlyn
---
Relay is a JavaScript framework designed for building data driven front end applications, using the rendering power of React. It is powered by a GraphQL API, a new API design which allows clients to dynamically request the exact shape of data they need. Graphene is a declarative python library which can be used to build a GraphQL API. Together, this is a powerful toolchain for building data driven applications, especially suited for those where you have many different ways of presenting the same data sets.

We will explore these technologies to build a simple application. This tutorial is most suited to developers with an interest in full stack development. A reasonable understanding of modern JavaScript and Django will be assumed, but no knowledge of React, Relay, GraphQL or Graphene is required.
