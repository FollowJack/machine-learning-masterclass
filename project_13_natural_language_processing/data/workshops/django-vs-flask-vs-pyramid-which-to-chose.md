The world of Python web frameworks is full of choices. 
Django, Flask, Pyramid, Tornado, Bottle, Diesel, Pecan, Falcon, and many more are competing for developer mindshare. 
As a developer you want to cut the array of options down to the one that will help you finish your project. 
I will focus on Flask, Pyramid, and Django. Their ideal cases span from micro-project to enterprise-size web service.
To help make the choice between the three easier (or at least more informed), we can build the same application in each framework and compare the code, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
