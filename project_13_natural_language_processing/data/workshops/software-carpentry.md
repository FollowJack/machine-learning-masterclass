Software Carpentry teaches researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and related disciplines the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. In this hands-on session, we'll work through an extract from our two-day curriculum, learning how to load, manipulate, analyse and plot tabular data with Python. 

## Prerequisites

1. Learners need to understand what files and directories are, what a working directory is and how to start a Python interpreter
2. Familiarity with Python's variables, assignment, data types and built-in functions would be helpful
3. Learners must complete the [setup instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/) to install Python and get the gapminder data before class starts
