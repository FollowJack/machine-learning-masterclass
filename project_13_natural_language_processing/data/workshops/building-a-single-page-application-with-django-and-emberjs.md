Are you curious about building REST APIs and connecting them to a frontend application?
Does frontend development sound scary or intriguing?
Would you like to learn about Django and Django REST Framework?
If you answered yes to any of those questions, come join us for this workshop!

Frontend frameworks are not that different from  backend frameworks. They are also MV*, and even if some of them are very different to what we are used to in the "backend world", some of them are really close to what we are used to with Django.

If you have no experience with Python, the MVC pattern or JavaScript at all, I would recommend that you first go through the Django Girls Tutorial  and watch Learn JavaScript in Your PJs!  to be able to fully enjoy this workshop.
