What is taste in code?  Is it important?  Is it universal?  Can it be standardised?

Can lessons from older disciplines teach us to write better code?  We've been building houses for thousands of years.  Can we use the hard won lessons from architecture to improve our work?

This talk will look at taste from a coder's point of view, and looking at other subjects that hopefully we can learn from, such as architecture, art, product design, and modernism.

There will be plenty of theory, some pretty pictures, but also we'll be looking at real examples of code and trying to answer some of these questions about practical examples.  Hopefully you will also start to gain the tools to express why you like or dislike certain practices.
