At Bristol Braille Technology we were faced with designing a user interface for a machine that hadn't been invented yet: an affordable multi-line Braille e-book reader. We chose Python for this unique challenge. 

This talk will go over the systems design and development history of the Canute Braille E-book Reader and it's UI, outline some of the advantages and disadvantages that Python brought to the table and possibly give a demo of the working device.
