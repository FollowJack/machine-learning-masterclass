The software industry as a whole is moving further towards integrating smaller systems together rather than building monoliths. This can be trickier than it appears, especially when the system needs to grow and evolve.

This talk is meant to help highlight some of the pitfalls that can trip up teams who may be used to creating smaller systems or monoliths, take a look at deployment, scaling and monitoring and discuss issues that are still problematic for us here at EnergyDeck.
