The data is Consumer Complaint Database from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database#topic=consumer_navigation

Key Questions answered in the objective:
1. Who are the customers?
- Why are they buying our product?
- How do we predict if a customer is going to buy our product?
- What is different from segments who are performing well and those that are performing below expectations?
- How much money will we lose if we donâ€™t actively sell the product to these groups?

## Objective
(1) The goal of the project is to assist customer service agents to increase the conversion rate.  (2) This will assist the agents in enriching and strengthen their word corpus.

(3) By early feature A/B testing we can measure the acceptance of the feature based on conversion changes.
