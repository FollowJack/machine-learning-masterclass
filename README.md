Projects:

- ... and separate notebooks to get deeper understanding and apply my experience.


In general autoamted scripts are provided. In any case you experience problems or having questions:
--> Open up a Github Issue

Some projects demand lower python version to function proberly. My default python version was 3.6.
--> Check in the scripts the virtualenv.sh for selecting the prober python version
